        <p>Nothing is what it looks like,<br>
          because Human Beings, are not of the world of sequentially predictable machines.</p>
        <p>Human Beings emerged, out of infinitely increasing complexity,<br>
          by rules of infinite accidents along lines of fuzzy principles.</p>
        <p>In a word, we are here because the Universe mixed it self for so long<br>
          that the failure for life to occur became inconceivable.</p>
        <p>And, we want to believe life emerged, on Earth,<br>
          just like we wanted to believe that earth was the center of the Universe.</p>
        <p>And we want to believe that Earth was the first to have life,<br>
          my goodness, how much more special could we be, the first in the Universe.</p>
        <p>Universe is a large place, that has been around for a long time,<br>
          it is better not to think of anything cosmic, as that! special.</p>
        <p>But there is one exception.</p>
        <p>Once you come down to Earth, come up to Life, and look then Into The Conscious Self Aware Mind,<br>
          that is no longer a common occurrence.</p>
        <p>There is nothing normal about it,<br>
          we are now at the limits of what the Universe could possibly conceive of.</p>
        <p>No machine or hybrid can measure up to the raw power of unleashed consciousness.</p>
        <p>Nothing partially conscious, can know the depth of Sadness,<br>
          nothing less than conscious could know the Miracle of Happiness.</p><br>
        <p>We are used to thinking of ourselves as work horses,<br>
          great locomotives that can plow through Pandemics, or a Broken Heart.</p>
        <p>But that is a temporary oversimplification just to keep visions clear,<br>
          born of a finely tuned mind that can narrow all views down to the important bits.</p>
        <p>Focus and selective attention is not a limitation of our mind,<br>
          it is a feature that clears away unimportant things.</p>
        <p>When we need recall, we can have it in full,<br>
          just imagine your favorite place, and trace along the walls.</p>
        <p>Every window, picture, appliance, and outlet, all the important knickknacks are all there,<br>
          we don&apos;t have memory problems, we don&apos;t need better brains.</p>
        <p>The convergence that we need is not about integrating with technology,<br>
          but combining the good parts of our cultures, so that the world can learn towards Peace.</p>
        <p>Without that shared wisdom, people are easily tricked to believe in conflict,<br>
          into the belief that there are borders, and across borders they must fight.</p>
        <p>By not helping each other to understand how special and unique we each are,<br>
          there grows a vocal minority of machine like minds, that think in mechanical terms.</p>
        <p>They add to get more, they take to be more,<br>
          they divide to make enemy, and subtract enemy to spread more.</p>
        <p>They think they are a cog, in a bigger machine,<br>
          but there is no machine, just that blind mind.</p><br>
        <p>It is OK to focus on just a few things so that we may grow, and grow in wisdom too,<br>
          but it is not OK to live in some narrow channel for simplicity sake.</p>
        <p>It actually isn&apos;t OK to do things to simplify,<br>
          complexity only moves in one direction.</p>
        <p>There is nothing healthy that can be done to un-mix a cup of tea,<br>
          there is nothing useful to be found in moving backwards in time.</p>
        <p>Complexity grows, and to make sense of growing complexity,<br>
          we cannot hope to simplify it, but rather adapt our minds to grasp it more efficiently.</p>
        <p>The World must Go Forward, Move Forward,<br>
          what needs to change is out Tolerance for Bad Ideas.</p>
        <p>But growing up to the challenges of ever increasing complexity requires wisdom,<br>
          and wisdom cannot be manufactured, it must be grown.</p>
        <p>Wisdom is a product of Love,<br>
          not the Beating Heart, but the Human Capacity to Love the Universe, The World, and The Human Family.</p><br>
        <p>My Dear Readers,<br>
          Becoming a Great Being, becoming Wise and Enlightened,<br>
          is the actual definition of being an Adult.</p>
        <p>Pretending to be an Adult, by acting mature,<br>
          is to make a fool of yourself, probably while throwing away what makes you Beautiful.</p>
        <p>Throwing away your Sweetens, and Foolishness, and Innocence, and all the Smiles that happen for no reason.<br>
          That&apos;s not growing up, that&apos;s the worst thing you can do to your self, and is probably very unhealthy.</p>
        <p>To become an Adult,<br>
          is to become a Philosopher.</p>
        <p>Philosophy is about Loving Wisdom,<br>
          is your Wisdom not the most precious thing within you?</p>
        <p>Universe, the biggest thing there is, in all it&apos;s might and complexity,<br>
          a thing so powerful, that it may in some part, travel around it self in time.</p>
        <p>It can&apos;t do wisdom, best it can do is Evolution,<br>
          but it can&apos;t do wisdom, it cannot know, it doesn&apos;t know such a thing could exist.</p>
        <p>And each and every one of us has the capacity for it,<br>
          a volitional faculty to bring up a folder of your Noblest Thoughts.</p>
        <p>You are more powerful than the Universe,<br>
          the only thing that can keep you down,<br>
          is you never becoming aware of your Great Power.</p>
        <p>I know Superman comes to mind when you think of Superpowers and Superheroes,<br>
          But do think Superman is actually super because he can lift or fly?</p>
        <p>If Superman was as super as he needs to be, he would become Human,<br>
          and build Schools to prevent War a Hundred Years before it happened.</p>
        <p>He&apos;d then age, so that the Little Ones,<br>
          would listen to him without dismissing him as a Genius that lives on cloud nine.</p>
        <p>He&apos;d then let the little ones build with a thousand minds,<br>
          what his one mind, couldn&apos;t grasp.</p>
        <p>The greatest of superheroes, would encourage us to build things,<br>
          that help the world to converge,<br>
          on Cultures of Wisdom that leave bad ideas behind.</p>
        <p>I ask you, My Dear Readers,<br>
          to begin moving towards becoming Great Wise Beings,<br>
          towards growing up by means of searching for wisdom,<br>
          growing all the way up so that you stand as Authentic Adults.</p>
        <p>And rising to the challenge of inspiring a thousand minds,<br>
          to accomplish what your one mind, can only barely conceive of today.</p>
