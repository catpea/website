        <p>I dreamt I was tumbling through time,<br>
          and I had no control over which fragments I see.</p>
        <p>There was a mother writing a letter to a famous movie star,<br>
          she was asking him to stop making movies, because her boy didn&apos;t comeback from war.</p>
        <p>And it worked,<br>
          and she wrote many letters.</p>
        <p>There was a lot of shocked artists and actors,<br>
          they had no idea how they shaped young impressionable minds.</p>
        <p>Boys wanted to go to real war,<br>
          to be like the imaginary heroes they saw on TV.</p><br>
        <p>And then I struggled in my dream, because my bullies were clearly ill, they were not all there,<br>
          but World&apos;s Systems of Justice do not differentiate between the ill and the healthy.</p>
        <p>And so a person made permanently ill in their mind by poverty,<br>
          is seen equal to a man of knowledge, insight, intelligence.</p>
        <p>But the ill have little freedom of choice,<br>
          they need therapy, and safety, and good homes, and hope, and dreams.</p>
        <p>To punish someone who couldn&apos;t grow up, didn&apos;t know to learn,<br>
          for something that they weren&apos;t sure they were doing,<br>
          and then to send them to a hopeless place without a hope of healing,<br>
          without any hope of rehabilitation... is wrong.</p>
        <p>If they can&apos;t walk among us, if they are permanently ill,<br>
          then build special schools for them, schools that bring hope.</p>
        <p>We mustn&apos;t punish them more than life already had,<br>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2tOp7OxyQ8">our humanity depends on everyone&#x2019;s humanity</a>.</p><br>
        <p>And I saw Mr. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6IKu2wgm5I">Pirsig</a> on his motorcycle with his boy,<br>
          the wind in his face representing the cutting edge of reality.</p>
        <p>He was worried that his Metaphysics is not real philosophy,<br>
          it was not going to be taken seriously.</p>
        <p>The answers they discovered on road they traveled and experiences they shared,<br>
          created the Body of Knowledge that provided them with the forward momentum they needed to move ahead.</p>
        <p>I dreamt that Pirsig was just talking bout Authenticity, Nobility and Dignity,<br>
          and Knowledge and Wisdom, and Wise Intuition.</p>
        <p>He is unafraid to show us how vulnerable Philosophers are,<br>
          that all it takes is ideas worth sharing, once or twice.</p>
        <p>Anybody can be a philosopher,<br>
          we will each be heard.</p><br>
        <p>All these strange fragments added together - to remind us that the World is Not Static,<br>
          that it grows, moves, changes, and cares not to stop for things writ on paper.</p>
        <p>Advancements in Psychology... the trailer to the movie about Philip Zimbardo work - alone,<br>
          should invalidate laws and behaviors previously thought acceptable.</p>
        <p>Humanity must grow, our cultures must drive us all forward,<br>
          we must never assume that the world we are born into is a masterpiece.</p>
        <p>And we must never let ourselves think,<br>
          that others are in charge - it is our world, it belongs to us all.</p><br>
        <p>To make informed decisions,<br>
          we require knowledge, wisdom, foresight, insight, a sense of belonging.</p>
        <p>Without knowledge, we will not be able to see right from wrong,<br>
          nor will any of our decisions do our elder selves justice.</p>
        <p>Access to well grounded knowledge is not difficult,<br>
          internet lectures - alone - may even suffice, but best selling non fiction audio books solve it completely.<br></p><br>
        <p>Humanity must not fall behind on growing up,<br>
          the longer the delay the greater the injustice.</p>
        <p>Read and Listen to you books, my Friends,<br>
          inherit the lifetimes of knowledge within.</p>
        <p>We can&apos;t send people to prison without any hope of rehabilitation,<br>
          for uninformed decisions that came on a whim.</p>
        <p>And we can&apos;t allow mere Practice of Law without Functional Rehabilitation,<br>
          and above all Meaningful Education and Universal Basic Income that truly lifts people out of Poverty.</p><br>
        <p>We Are The People,
          we outgrew borders long ago, we are One Family on a Lonely Blue Earth.<br></p>
        <p>We must learn to catch up with what is worthy of knowing,<br>
          we can use Science, or Love, or both, or the Leading Edge of Instinct powered by our Humanity.</p>
        <p>But we must continue building this world,<br>
          each generation must make improvements and never stop.</p>
        <p>Those who stand in power today,<br>
          are to soon gracefully surrender to the better wisdom of the new generation.</p>
        <p>To preside is to wisely wait whilst the new generation becomes worthy of the position,<br>
          and to quietly step down, and put whatever wisdom was discovered to the books of history.</p>
        <p>To preside, means not, to continue repeating mistakes because they are on the books,<br>
          and therefore one will not be punished.</p>
        <p>There are only two sides to history, and only fools think it is the winning and the losing one,<br>
          the two sides as seen by future generations is the Wrong One, and The Noble One.</p>
        <p>Let us all rise to the challenges of wisdom,<br>
          and making lasting and meaningful contributions to the Human Family.</p>
        <p>Let us not be lost to the wrong side,<br>
          let us not be passed over by the books of history,<br>
          let us help wisdom propagate.</p>
        <p>Let us stand up to every corner and every challenge,<br>
          and let us speak out against the wrong, the mistakes, the incomplete, the unfinished.</p>
        <p>Let us not accept half measures, or good enough, or status quo,<br>
          or the lowest common denominator minimums that get commited to law books.</p>
        <p>Let us remember who we are,<br>
          and how Noble The Human Being.</p>
        <p>Let us stand upright,<br>
          in Authenticity, Dignity, Wisdom and Compassion.</p>
