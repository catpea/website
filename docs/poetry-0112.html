        <p>Since we can&apos;t see future clearly,<br>
          the risk is simply too great not to take the higher more challenging roads.</p>
        <p>If we are mistaken about the importance of growing up,<br>
          and choose to push, and climb, and become Great Beings, anyway.</p>
        <p>Well, we can hardly say that we have fooled ourselves,<br>
          Becoming a Brilliant and Beautiful Being, is probably pretty hard to regret.</p><br>
        <p>But if we are mistaken about the importance of growing up,<br>
          and put opinion above fact, fantasy over reality, merely age and never grow.</p>
        <p>If we reject real education for grades, and GPA, and a photo op,<br>
          and a mere feeling of maturity, but also, fear and no motivation to continue.</p>
        <p>If we reach the age of retirement,<br>
          confused, or breakable, and lost.</p>
        <p>Then we will regret this,<br>
          surely.</p>
        <p>And although we won&apos;t know what might have been, we will have a feeling,<br>
          that Growing Up would have brought us clarity, unbreakability, and calm.</p><br>
        <p>The risk of misunderstanding the importance of Growing Up,<br>
          is too great, let us all aim to become Great Beings, My Friends.</p>
        <p>The Beauty of Beginnings,<br>
          it that they are always simple.</p>
        <p>There are very few unfamiliar things that play a role in rising,<br>
          after all, we only rise to become More Human, All Too Human.</p>
        <p>We are born with this ability,<br>
          it <em>has to be</em> within each and every one of us.</p><br>
        <p>It starts in childhood, as we venture to explore,<br>
          be it a garden, or some rusty machinery, or the alien worlds beyond the train tracks.</p>
        <p>And like interesting pebbles in a pocket, our observations add,<br>
          and as a whole stand to mean more.</p><br>
        <p>Once our mind begins to flourish a decade later,<br>
          what we found of interest, or the things that created more questions, lead us to books.</p>
        <p>We discover that there were others there walking that path before us,<br>
          and what once was a twinkling star, becomes a Distant Sun, not unlike our Sun.</p>
        <p>And where once darkness was,<br>
          there is now a ray of light.</p><br>
        <p>And we must stay on this path, My Friends,<br>
          everyone will try to push you, claim to know better.</p>
        <p>Siblings, Parents, Teachers, Friends, your Boss,<br>
          they will have few motives, and little to explain.</p><br>
        <p>If you resist, or rise again, and find your way forward,<br>
          the Universe will continue adding to your Knowledge.</p>
        <p>You will slowly begin to become;<br>
          less what others need - and more of who you really are.</p>
        <p>Your knowledge will begin overflowing,<br>
          it will create a vast ocean.</p>
        <p>And then the waves will finally come,<br>
          churn, turn, tickle; help you up, and rest and relax, and feel safe.</p>
        <p>And that is the first plateau, the first step towards Your Greatness,<br>
          the finding of calm, and the successful resistance of what others want you to be.</p><br>
        <p>The waves will carry you,<br>
          but the ocean you swim in is your knowledge, is perfectly familiar, and friendly.</p>
        <p>And just reach out,<br>
          to what you will love next.</p>
        <p>And touch and remember,<br>
          and let the next plateau emerge.</p><br>
        <p>Your plateaus, their order, and height and color, are not just a path to Greatness,<br>
          they are also your Beauty.</p>
        <p>Anybody can know what you know,<br>
          but only you will build your road to Greatness in that particular sequence and style.</p><br>
        <p>You may start with Mountainous Adventure, add Celestial Cartography,<br>
          followed by a venture into your own Photography Business.</p>
        <p>These are the waves of your own personal private school of life,<br>
          your ever expanding ocean, your Thriving Living Body of Knowledge.</p>
        <p>There is no one single direction here,<br>
          it is all directions all the time.</p><br>
        <p>So as long as you resist being pushed to places that are alien to you,<br>
          and carry on building Your Universe Within, you can only grow.</p><br>
        <p>More than what to think,<br>
          it is important to learn how to think.</p>
        <p>More than others pushing you around,<br>
          you must let your own ocean move you.</p>
        <p>No one can enact an external force on you,<br>
          that can ever be greater than the power that is already within you.</p>
        <p>Nothing external, or yet unfamiliar to you,<br>
          can move you as much as that which you Cherish, Admire and Love.</p>
        <p>Grow in the Sequence that Makes You a Force of Nature,<br>
          and at the familiar pace that your ocean expands at.</p><br>
        <p>To become a Great Being, to Grow All The Way Up,<br>
          is to become Perfectly Unbreakable out of all the Uncompressible treasure within you.</p>
        <p>Do not be sacred, for that which is in your power, becomes your power,<br>
          and that which is not - is not your fault.</p>
        <p>Rise,<br>
          My Friends.</p>
