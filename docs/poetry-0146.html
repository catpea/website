          <p>The Philosophers attempt to bring ideas to the future generations,<br>
            they are masters of learning how to think, conceptualize, and get extremely smart.</p>
          <p>There are a few things that we must set aside at first,<br>
            and above all remember that they were children once, teenagers, that they are all too human.</p>
          <p>When possible we should begin with survey courses and general overviews,<br>
            Video Lectures and Audio Books on the subject of Philosophy in general.</p><br>
          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Philosophy">The Story of Philosophy: The Lives and Opinions of the Greater Philosophers</a><br>
            is a great start, Ariel and Will Durant seem like an amazing couple.</p>
          <p>In 1977 they were presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Gerald Ford,<br>
            and Ariel was named &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; by the city of Los Angeles.</p>
          <p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=The+Giants+of+Philosophy+Series">The Giants of Philosophy Series</a> is a set of 13 Audio Books surveying word&apos;s top Philosophers,<br>
            written by multiple authors and narrated by Charlton Heston.</p><br>
          <p>We must not judge a Philosophy by the mistakes of the Philosopher,<br>
            if they did make mistakes, then they published hoping to be granted a hearing.</p>
          <p>We should avoid memorizing, ideally we want to approach Philosophers that we find familiar,<br>
            and perhaps already having re-invented some portion of what they worked on.</p><br>
          <p>One concept that comes to mind is Amor Fati,<br>
            it means Love of Fate.</p>
          <p>But to me, it does not speak about the kind of fate where everything is pre-determined,<br>
            or the fate of a person who lets whim and life push them around, but rather events that just happen.</p>
          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> wrote a great deal about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_fati">Amor Fati</a>,<br>
            but in my opinion he takes it too far as he speaks of Suffering, he runs into the extremes.</p>
          <p>My bullies are an example of Extremes and Suffering,<br>
            and Amor Fati does not mean I should love my bullies, and Friedrich states as much:</p>
          <p>&quot;Only great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit. I doubt that such pain makes us &#x2018;better&#x2019;; but I know that it makes us more profound.&quot;<br>
            (Thanks Friedrich, My Dear Old Friend.)</p>
          <p>Albert Camus brings it down to reality,<br>
            speaking of accepting that life comes with Difficulty and Ease, and we should accept both.</p>
          <p>&quot;A will to live without rejecting anything of life... is the virtue I honor most in this world.&quot;</p><br>
          <p>It is not enough to learn <strong>about</strong> a philosophical concept like we just did,<br>
            we should hope to integrate it, or keep it as a reminder that we have more to learn before we understand it fully.</p>
          <p>The way I connect with Amor Fati,<br>
            is by understanding that not everything in my life will happen for a reason,<br>
            some thing will just happen out of complexity and randomness that we can&apos;t prevent; and that to me is fate.</p>
          <p>I like how Albert Camus telks about Ease and Difficulty and the way I understand him,<br>
            is that we should stand up for what we believe in, even if it means that people will yell at us.</p>
          <p>So it is not tolerance of difficult things that just happen for no reason,<br>
            but the difficulty of standing up for what we believe in when the chance presents it self, for no reason- you see.</p>
          <p>Our decision making which dictates our path in life,<br>
            has nothing to do with things that happen for no reason.</p>
          <p>Finally, Amor Fati simply means,<br>
            do not let things that you have no control over take away from your Love of Life.</p><br>
          <p>While this may not be exactly what Friedrich Nietzsche and Albert Camus talk about,<br>
            my initial, more personal interpretation, gives me a platform from which I can learn both of their interpretations and mutual differences.</p>
          <p>And what I am showing here, is that we don&apos;t have to understand all the philosophical concepts right away,<br>
            that it is best to learn a little bit at a time, at our own pace, and in our own sequence.</p>
