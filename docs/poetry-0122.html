          <p>To rise, to become strong, to grow and to break away and become more authentic,<br>
            is our first great responsibility, and our health.</p>
          <p>However, it does go against our nature as children,<br>
            we have a tendency not to look outside of the culture we are brought into.</p>
          <p>Rite of Passage is about crossing that line,<br>
            the line between The Child That Follows, and The Adult That Leads.</p>
          <p>The moment we can handle looking at ourselves and our culture,<br>
            from the <strong>outside</strong> in, we begin crossing the line into adulthood.</p><br>
          <p>One of the first few thoughts may be, &quot;But what if I was born into a different religion?&quot;<br>
            followed by, &quot;What if I was not born into this economic class, into this poverty?&quot;.</p>
          <p>As these questions grow from asking about ourselves, to also including others,<br>
            they bring us insight into the greater Human Condition.</p>
          <p>Bring us to the question of The Freedom of Will, of how much our Personality is Our Own,<br>
            of internal decision making heavily influenced by external culture or placement.</p>
          <p>As we grow we begin asking even greater questions about others,<br>
            &quot;Would the petty thief stole, had he <strong>not</strong> been fractured by the virus of poverty?&quot;</p>
          <p>Our minds begin scanning for solutions that aim towards a Greater Good,<br>
            towards Word Peace, International Convergence on Wisdom, Unites States of The World.</p>
          <p>We begin seeing that although there isn&apos;t an answer to every question,<br>
            there are Dreams that could prevent the worst of World&apos;s Mistakes.</p><br>
          <p>Building schools to help a culture grow,<br>
            instead of forecasting war and manufacturing enough weapons.</p>
          <p>Preventing the existence of criminals,<br>
            by helping little children to Happy Homes, and to a Universal Basic Income.</p>
          <p>Trading simple schools and grades for Business Success,<br>
            helping children to become Well Funded Entrepreneurs and Investors.</p><br>
          <p>No matter which questions we begin with and how our path is arranged,<br>
            we discover how critical Growing Up is, for us, for eveyone.</p>
          <p>How much more we are,<br>
            than mere followers of the rules that we are born to.</p>
          <p>How important to our mental health,<br>
            it is not to fall a victim to bad ideas or fractures of poverty.</p>
          <p>Our First Great Act in life is lifting ourselves above the culture we are born into,<br>
            that is the meaning of the words Rising, Growing Up, Breaking Away, Becoming Stronger.</p><br>
          <p>And the acts of independent thinking that are sure to follow,<br>
            are the very foundation of Our Hope in a Better Future.</p>
          <p>Have no fear of Rising, of Breaking Away, of Growing Up, of Growing In Strength,<br>
            for that is Adulthood, and none can stay children for long.</p>
          <p>Close your eyes, and begin building,<br>
            because your next step is to become a Great Being.</p>
