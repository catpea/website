        <p>When we are still learning what the world is,<br>
          we find comfort in recognizing where something starts, and where it ends.</p>
        <p>Knowing the beginning and seeing the ending helps us feel in control,<br>
          it helps us see the journey&apos;s end, or the height of a challenge.</p>
        <p>But all of that goes away when we begin rising,<br>
          eventually we only consider the forward motion it self.</p>
        <p>We ignore the beginning, we abandon the ends, we ignore the steps,<br>
          and we stop measuring the distance and paying attention to the effort.</p>
        <p>In advancing forward we learn to recognize that all things must connect,<br>
          we can only find peace in a mesh-work of common concerns and dreams upheld by all.</p>
        <p>The roads we must travel have no limits, and it never takes long to catch up,<br>
          nobody falls behind for too long unless they practice resignation.</p>
        <p>We need not travel far to begin seeing that the word is still very young,<br>
          that passage of wisdom between generations is a very fragile process.</p>
        <p>Many, who are not yet mature enough for the position they have gained, may feign authority,<br>
          we have to be careful who we listen to and be mindful of the paths they have traveled.</p>
        <p>We are the sum of all our rising, all our triumph, effort, and intent across all our ages,<br>
          how we rose, and the choices we made, and the wisdom we grew with, all adds to the sum.</p>
        <p>That sum doesn&apos;t just outline our personality and who we are in the now,<br>
          it is the structure of our wisdom and the body of our knowledge, directed towards who we will become in the future.</p>
        <p>A choice we make in the now, will paint a moment in our past, but also influence what is yet to come,<br>
          and all the choices added together create who we are in the future that we will eventually enter.</p>
        <p>We must take great care of our choices, we must take care to love ourselves,<br>
          to find the calm and peace from which we can make healthy decisions that will help us grow.</p>
        <p>Not everyone will start in a colorful city with good schools and amazing friends,<br>
          some will struggle to rise out of extremes that will never make sense.</p>
        <p>But we must still set ourselves on that unlimited path,<br>
          and get used to the idea of no beginnings, and no ends, just that all too human forward motion.</p>
        <p>The direction is always the same, move towards wisdom,<br>
          that is the meeting point of all human beings no matter their circumstance or culture.</p>
        <p>We begin as children, we mature into adults, and then we must go on to become Great Beings,<br>
          all Greatness is rooted in Love of Wisdom, and the root of wisdom is found in boldly facing the challenges of life.</p>
