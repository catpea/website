          <p>Like steps on a mountain, each epoch stands in support of the next,<br>
            like the pages of a journal, together, they hold the sacred text.</p>
          <p>We learn, we may fail, or triumph, and the next epoch follows,<br>
            but every new epoch grows from the one previous.</p>
          <p>We can&apos;t leap from one place to another,<br>
            we can only move up, or graduate up, or build up, or step up.</p>
          <p>To leap, is to stay a child in an aging body,<br>
            to go up, to grow up, and carry on to no end, is to become an adult.</p><br>
          <p>In our youth we must learn to stand our ground,<br>
            and anchor ourselves to something that moves us.</p>
          <p>As we age, having followed that path,<br>
            we&apos;ll be standing upon our own mountain,</p>
          <p>A great mountain of personal wisdom,<br>
            where once only a direction lay.</p>
          <p>These mountains rise with each epoch in our life,<br>
            every once in a while we pause, to bring all that we are together - higher.</p>
          <p>Epoch by Epoch, we ascend, we can already see the sunshine,<br>
            but our journey comes with no end.</p><br>
          <p>This is a simple life, first we conform and then break away,<br>
            we become wise, and later in life, our wisdom transforms into Enlightenment.</p>
          <p>It is a road of Adventures, Books, Poems, and Inspirations,<br>
            it has tears of sadness, but in return we grow stronger.</p>
          <p>What it is all for, is to Live a Life of Simple Dignity,<br>
            or rising when we fall, of learning when we get tricked.</p>
          <p>Of protecting our bodies and minds, and growing stronger,<br>
            of adding to our existing body of wisdom.</p><br>
          <p>With each epoch we climb over what we previously thought were our limits,<br>
            As we get up, and stand up, we reach a new plateau.</p>
          <p>We rest, we take in the sun of this new height,<br>
            and get busy building higher, and higher.</p>
          <p>None of us begged to be born, we were nothingness,<br>
            and temporarily all these atoms came together to give us, ourselves.</p>
          <p>And eventually, we&apos;ll return to our nothingness,<br>
            and the atoms will disperse, to become parts of other beautiful things,</p><br>
          <p>While we are in this state, however, the first and foremost order!<br>
            ...is to Thrive, to Grow, to Expand, to Rise, to Build, and to Ascend.</p>
          <p>Whether we know it yet or not, the road that we are on, is one.<br>
            It is the same road that our 90 year old selves will wonder about.</p>
          <p>They will go up and down the Epochs, and ask questions.<br>
            there will be some regrets, but we do have a chance to solve them now.</p>
          <p>There will be enough triumph to bring blinding light to all the sadness,<br>
            and the beautiful memories will wipe out all the unimportant things.</p><br>
          <p>All that stands in the way of our growing up,<br>
            must be pushed aside, growing up is our life.</p>
          <p>We must grow up, rise up, all the way up.<br>
            Each and every epoch ahead, demands this.</p>
          <p>Our minds require wisdom, wisdom fuels our decision making,<br>
            and our choices dictate all our life ahead.</p>
          <p>Life is precious, it is to be lived in Dignity and Authenticity,<br>
            and you are meant to become a Great Being.</p>
