best.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Haste of organized education, threats of losing a 4.0 GPA,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;homework deadlines, and even subconsciously knowing that memorization is not education, will conspire against us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Learning for real, real education, useful knowledge,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;thriving wisdom, and eventual greatness demands a beautiful and authentic existence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In real life, getting a diploma by cramming, memorizing, winging it or getting lucky,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;doesn&amp;apos;t actually do anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Reality, demands real things,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;truth, authenticity, and a healthy existence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A beautiful life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;requires our full beauty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;To bloom, to truly grow up,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we need to be truly free, we need to reside in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is not as easy as it sounds,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;though we all have the ability to set ourselves free from childhood indoctrination.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;What about, the less obvious things?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Such as doing badly on a test some years ago, having your GPA permanently lowered because of it,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but on the day of graduation, actually being able to perfectly pass that test, but now during graduation it being too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;So you are accepting a lower GPA, so that you can graduate sooner?&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that is not how reality works, and what about the extra motivation that you would receive from keeping a 4.0 GPA throughout your entire stay?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And what about the quality of that test,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and what about the people that passed it because they memorized it without really learning anything?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And what about the fact that that many will never need what was on that test,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in effect the College or University slowing their progress down, distracting them from learning what would help them become more of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And what about well connected and ingratiated liars, at the company you do end up working at,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;what if after years of tests and textbooks and frightening and stressful debt, a liar dislikes you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Reality, will make you strong and beautiful, it will make your life meaningful and full of joy,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but you have to keep it real, the education must be real, your place of employment must be stable and honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;At no point should you be pushed to the side,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and forced to walk a path that is different from who you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And do not forget, that we are granted a set amount of time,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;spending more than 30 years in pursuit of school and career that isn&amp;apos;t guaranteed to be what you need, should be a tough proposition.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Now, a real education coupled with a series of business undertakings that you learn from,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and eventual launch of a successful company based on what you have learned is a lot more stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;So, High School, College, University and a Career,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;does not hold the same guarantee that Self Education and eventually becoming a Successful Founder, does.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If you start leaning towards the Start-up Culture in High School,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you can start building your companies a lot sooner, and begin isolating and mastering the lessons that you actually need in the right sequence and at the right pace.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Just for the fact that there are no bullies when you learn on your own,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and zero pressure to memorize, and zero classes that will only distract you from learning what you need, self education is better for your mental health and growing up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Cults and religions are not the only indoctrination,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they are just the ones that are trivial to catch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A Real University, would only feature Great Thinkers, Great Actors and Narrators,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but even so, their beautiful performances, though eye catching, would never be as perfectly fitted to you as a series of fine hand-picked audio books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Even an imaginary perfect-university, cannot match the power of a collection of audio books that you can listen and re-listen stress free,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;as you learn to build you companies and graduate to be able to grasp more and more complex subjects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Lets just face it, being placed in a situation where you must merely memorize things,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is a sign that you are being taken advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Learning is not about memorization,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and memorization has nothing to do with learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Memorization is best used in poetry,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it a way to give thanks to poets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Even if you memorize numbers of a new language,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;all you have left is a piece of information that is not yet useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Memorizing 100 of the most popular words in a language you are learning,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is almost dangerous as you will have trouble with correct pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;To learn a new language, you are best to create a path you can navigate and expand,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;watch a movie you are already familiar with in your native language, and build a transcript.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We are good at language,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;just like we are good at dance, don&amp;apos;t force it, love it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Your Knowledge is sacred,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it empowers your decision making, and helps your dreams come true.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;When someone barges in forcing you to heartlessly memorize things,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you must become very suspicious of their motives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The world is poor, there are slick talking people out there with all kinds of issues,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;sometimes they are deans, principals, teachers, and even parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You have to find a way to learn things right,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I think we all know, that way, is not the school way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I know you are scared, bad grades, yelling parents, threat of poverty and homelessness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but you see, that won&amp;apos;t go away when you graduate by cramming, you are only delaying it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Moreover, by not becoming educated as soon as you can,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you become vulnerable to slick talking attackers, and shitty boyfriends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is damn hard to catch a liar, so hard that we can almost assume that liars always do win,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is because in their sickens they learn to exploit our cognitive biases.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The way to push back against manipulators,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is to become smarter than they are, and believe you me, this barely takes any effort at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;At most, AT MOST, 25 five audio books about modern life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;though they must all have a positive ending, they have to be happy books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;25 audio books is like a month of your life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and, and, and if I may, it will be one of the most beautiful times of your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You will always return to where you were as you read them,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;so you better go to a nice place, or get in your car get on the longest highway and drive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You can either start your life with a heart break,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or with adventure and audio books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Grab your friends, tell them to behave,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and go together.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If I may make a suggestion, lease stop at every antique store,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;as neat as the knickknacks are going to be, look for the most worn out books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I found a saintly copy of Robinson Crusoe,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it fits in my back pocket so perfectly, I can&amp;apos;t even.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Look for Jack London, Herman Melville, Daniel Defoe,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and keep an eye out for works by Friedrich Nietzsche.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Use the paper versions to practice narration, but listen to the audio books,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they are often out on Librivox.org for free as most of the classics are in public domain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;That is all you need, to create an adventure,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a path to somewhere far that hits as many antique stores as you can drive by.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And promise to drive carefully,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you are not in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Now, not everyone is ready to write,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but some of you are a lot further along than you think.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Begin by writing a singe compound sentence at a time,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that&amp;apos;s it, don&amp;apos;t press, flow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Just like dehydration happens, or we sometimes develop vitamin deficiencies,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and need to pay extra attention to what we put in our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;My friends, same goes for our minds,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;fear or anxiety will cause you harm, you are not to live in fear of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Do you know what the symptoms of anxiety are?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Impatience, snapping at small things, thinning hair, wanting to be alone,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;sadness, brain fog, body aches, fatigue, bad sleep habits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;These are not things that we can fix, you can&amp;apos;t take pain killers for body aches from from fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;By calling it adventure, I give you a simple choice to make,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but it is more than a simple adventure, I am inviting you on a quest away from the toxic sludge of an unexamined life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In a way, psychology is a young science,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is also the most humble and loving of all the Daughters of Philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;apos;t too many answers here,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but there is something, and I can fit it in a sentence for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The secret to a long and healthy life is:&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I am asking you to move away from fear and other disorders that create countless issues,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and get on a path towards happiness, because that is a very powerful medicine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Happiness is quite a thing,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is almost on par with wisdom, though I suppose it the end it is one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Where wisdom makes you a beautiful writer,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;happiness makes you a powerful doctor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The low key sarcastic, low brow, poker face, dead pan nonsense,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that will feature in your journals due to Happiness and Love of Life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Has the power to bring the most boorish and scared person from the brink of death,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and plop them in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley, walking stick in one hand and a bewildered companion in the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I once wondered how we could describe the most powerful beings on earth,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and somehow I came up with a two word description that still frightens-me-a-little to this day:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The Laughing Philosopher.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;While, I guess, I am not a real doctor, though the results are not quite in yet,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I am certain that even those who are deeply sad will find something that will bring them a special kind of Happiness when out on an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And I would argue, that the saddest of us, are the least likely to be eaten by a bobcat,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or dragged away by a condor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And I know for certain, that the saddest of us,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;are the ones that eventually tell the happiest and most triumphant of stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;All you need to do, is be aware of the terrible fact,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that the first few days of your adventure will feel wrong; you have to snarl through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Fight the urge to turn the car around,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that is just the toxic sludge within you fighting for survival, make sure it loses the battle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It will only take a few days,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and then, everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Oh my, when you get out of your car,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and your hiking or trail running shoes hit the gravel, it is like hearing bells of kissing a hundred woodland faeries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;By taking that first detoxified step of your new adventure away from lies, bullies, limits and fears,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you can perfectly understand why dogs get zoomies sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And hearing your first chipmunk,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;will absolutely put all the damn birds to shame.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;No job, or school, or employer, or alarm clock with a creepy snooze button, or any damn thing,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;has any right to your joy of life - do you hear me?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You joy of life is sacred,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;everything else has to be secondary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You are at your most beautiful, and you contribute to the world the most,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;when you are Happy, and occasionally mischievous.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Call it an adventure, or intellectual hygiene,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but keep your backpack by the door, and may you be always ready, for the call of the wild.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Because that will mark the rise of your own personal University,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and the beginning of your quest for real education and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

             <p class="card-text small">Though mighty, we are very delicate creatures,
our minds require Beauty and Calm to learn the most at their best.

Haste of organized education, threats of losing a 4.0 GPA,
homework deadlines, and even subconsciously knowing that memorization is not education, will conspire against us.

Learning for real, real education, useful knowledge,
thriving wisdom, and eventual greatness demands a beautiful and authentic existence.

In real life, getting a diploma by cramming, memorizing, winging it or getting...</p>

is,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;eventually, given enough time, and space, it emerges out of mere chaos and accident.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;When you look around this planet,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;despite lateral gene transfer, unstoppable power of selection, we are the only branch that can reach wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I think it is safe to say that some animals love and care, maybe admire,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but unfortunately try as they might Chimpanzees, Dolphins and Elephants can&amp;apos;t build cities of thoughts and dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In a word, we, the emergent intelligent creatures, are:&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;rare.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In two words:&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Beautiful and Rare.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We have to examine what sets us apart from Chimpanzees ad Dolphins,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and see what we can weave with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In the misery of cold caves,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or the torture or concentration camps imagining gods goes a long way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In the dark ages of child labor,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or the sickness of slavery and inequality school goes a long way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In the age of Mustard Gas,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or poverty and disease and hungry rats, a national border goes far.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In the age of Mutually Assured Destruction,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Cold War and Global Threats, a University education can be useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But in the age of Internet, we enter a new era,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;where what imaginary gods, simple schools, crazy borders, and trendy universities bring us, is actually, unimpressive and clunky.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We grew,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;my friends, it happened just now, just like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A new way of learning:&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Audio Books on The Trail.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;No university lecture,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;can beat twelve beloved and world celebrated books on the same subject.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Unlike Professors, books will bring you many a message, that you will discover between the lines,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or in the lines of a companion memoir or biography.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A professor will teach you Nuclear Physics,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but he cannot teach you the Love necessary not to participate in weapons research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A memoir,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;will.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;All the great books are connected, in the library books on weapons development will be connected to books about suffering in war,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to books about the promise of World Peace...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And if not, then the Librarian will catch you with her smile, before you fall,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;by contrast a Professor&amp;apos;s smile is meaningless, if not fake.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Professors can only interfere with your development,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;no single university covers enough subjects to satisfy you, but a library does.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;While your Knowledge is a sure path to Wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;there is something else, you need.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You need a taste of Greatness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will never find it in a University town, never.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;There is but a handful of places on earth that will help you feel it,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;those are the months long hiking trails found on each continent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;When you connect the triumph of adapting to the hardships of a trail,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in rain in snow...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;...to the inheritance of wisdom from books,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I am sorry to say, that the first thing you will feel is a brief flash rage and tears.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;For how could the Good World and the Professors you once respected betray you,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;by putting you into a little dorm room.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And no lecture hall is big enough, or prestigious enough,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to impress you more than the stars, and the silence, and fragrance of woods.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;How could an old and experienced Professor teach you poetry, better,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;than your beating heart, on the eve of your first encounter with a Bear, and her cubs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;No professor could ever reach as deep into your heart,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;as a book of inspirational verse, on that stormy night that you should have stayed in the valley below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And the Greatness of a simple warm morning filled with the fragrance of pine trees with a hint of last evening&amp;apos;s bonfire,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that thick moist air, as you hand spiritually pushes straight through each page of paper book that you now comprehend better than the author, the day he finished.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;He wrote as a mail sorter, or cast away, or patent clerk, or a star crossed overman,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but you read it, as an Emergent Masterpiece of The Universe, a Complete Human Being.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Let the trail,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;become your semesters and diplomas and awards, and the returns to it, you never-ending graduation ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;SPEAK OUT,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;do not let the others live unaware that Universities in their mediocrity have fallen to Nature Trails and Audio Books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;SPEAK OUT,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;do not let other students aim for a job, their job is to build companies, onwards to becoming Great Leaders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;SPEAK OUT,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;tell them about your rage and tears of being denied a real education that fits you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Speak Out,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;speak out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In wisdom, and in certainty of knowing that your path is the correct path,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is the path of real results, Wisdom, and Greatness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The Trail,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that thread, are one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And the grades, every one of your grades will far surpass any and all scales,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in cold rain, in snow too deep to traverse, in hunger two days out from the next town, upon your arrival you rise to a new height, that no grade can mark.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;After a few years,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;what you have weaved out of your books, will be unbreakable, and so unique as to extend precisely who yo are, far into, who you must become to reach greatness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A day will come, when you will notice the struggle of authors to rise higher,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and in sadness discover that you will find fewer and fewer books that move you, eventually where your last book ends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Your own book,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;will start.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And you will add to the mountain peak you climbed,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and others will follow, and your book will become their last book, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;apos;s how you will know what is real,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;what is fake, by taking every important step to the highest of heights and leaving your Soul behind for others to resurrect it when your book comes up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Worry not, countless others have traveled these roads,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;wisdom is real, it is meaningful, it changes you and others for better, and your book will be irreplaceable and beloved by many.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And, no, it is foolish to think that you must become an author to write a book, there are too many of those books already,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you only need to become wise to write, there are no critics here, as you cry, the reader will cry, as you climb the next mountain, the reader will triumph with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Take your self-education to the trails,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the nature will help you slow down and connect with the spirits of the authors stored within the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;apos;t worry, it will be OK,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;so as long as all your steps count as a triumph, your growing up will become an upward slope, and your life will eventually become as beautiful as you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And the last thing a Great Being discovers,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is the answer to their first big question &amp;quot;Who am I?&amp;quot;, it will all lay open as you look back from your golden age.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Your path to wisdom intertwined with adventure and great discoveries,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and bears, and dunes, and Fox Fire, and rain and snow, and softness of moss, and endless seas of fern, open like all the great ideas behind all the most beloved of poems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

Even as babies we know that wisdom separates a child from an adult,
it isn&#39;t just about growing older, anybody can just age, it is...</p>

&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Without wisdom a Police officer will unravel into a thug,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;with wisdom, disobey orders and protect those who fight for goodness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Without wisdom, children made to become soldiers, will kill each other,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;with wisdom, they will turn right around and look their fathers, and commanders in the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Without wisdom politicians will fuel tensions among the nations of the world,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;with wisdom, they will immediately dismantle nuclear weapons and ban war, not just unethical weapons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Without wisdom religious leaders divide the world and create open wounds that will never heal,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in wisdom, they will rise up against human rights violations and become popularizes of science and reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Without wisdom leaders will see criminals as &amp;quot;needing to be brought to heel&amp;quot;,&lt;/p&gt;\n

mind parade the color of their skin, or hair as a sign of superiority,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;with wisdom we will admire our beautiful uniqueness the wy we admire the colors of each others eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The word Philosophy comes from Greek,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it means Love of

&lt;p&gt;It is something that we are predisposed for, by Nature,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Wisdom is the next big step that Humanity must take.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Ineffective Education, and Education driven by propaganda or fantasies,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is hurting our progress forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Our education is a very delicate process,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;fear of being held back, or bad grades, or being taught fairy tales or falsehoods delays our progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Poverty, homelessness, hunger, self medication, and violence,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;prevents us from learning, and we cannot make out way towards wisdom in that state.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We have to protect the children from our lack of wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and help them to understand that the only way they can have a future is by means of Wisdom and the Love it entails.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We have to encourage children to become Great Beings,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and we have to admit that we can&amp;apos;t fix the world because it is a multi-generational project.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The repairs that are required rely on increased levels of Honest and Real Education throughout the world,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;no more noise, no more haste, no more grades or levels or division that render subjects incomprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A real school is marked by real results,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;by helping all their students towards Real Wisdom onward to helping them become Great Beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Today, very few graduates can see value in retaking all exams that helped them graduate,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and fewer still would be able to get the grades that prove that school was effective.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We confuse our amazing ability to learn, with school&amp;apos;s ability to teach,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and we suffer for it, most of us are tricked into thinking that we aren&amp;apos;t that smart, but the truth is that the school isn&amp;apos;t that good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Do not let schools trick you away from Wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we are an important link in a chain that connect past to the future, we must aim to become wise and teach wisdom as the highest value.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The world will stand still when divided,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;when united in wisdom we will rise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

grow,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the first thing that comes to mind is fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I am really worried about the ease,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;with which we can be indoctrinated into false beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I mean we are all born into a world&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;with intercontinental ballistic missiles pointed at all cities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We accept this all to easily,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;most of us never pays any attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The mechanism behind our blind acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is also the same mechanism that may launch them someday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;To really see all the things we need to fix,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we have to wiggle ourselves out of any and all indoctrinations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;One of our most powerful superpowers,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is thinking by subtle analogy to something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;That is one of the mechanisms that powers our wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we can see or solve problems based on other things we find in books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;There are three people that influenced my ideas about education the most,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Richard+Dawkins\&#34;&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts\&#34;&gt;Erica Goldson&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Sir+Ken+Robinson\&#34;&gt;Saintly Sir Ken Robinson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;When I look at them, I feel like I copied everything from them,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but that&amp;apos;s just means we are all fighting toward similar goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The thing that sticks out about me is this notion of wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I absolutely believe that we are all great thinkers that eventually become wise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And unlike Sir Robinson who urges to reform,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or Miss Godson who want to work together.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I mostly want to encourage students to stop trusting schools,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and accept the responsibility for their own education.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I do not think that being bombarded by mixtures of lessons and homework,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is good for learning, I think it only induces cramming, and renders a student uneducated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Sir Robinson mentions,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that there is a small percentage of students that do thrive in school.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But you see what Erica Goldson is saying,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;she&amp;apos;s is only good at passing tests, and she&amp;apos;s scared.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Richard Dawkins is a scientist who urges people,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to focus on the The Magic of Reality, rather than any other magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The way he takes to the stage,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and the way he moves an audience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;His dignity and certainty of knowing-that he is correct,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that he is helping the world grow, is an perfect example of a Great Being.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The title of this text,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;comes from a question asked by a young [presumably religions] lady: &amp;quot;&lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mmskXXetcg\&#34;&gt;What if you&amp;apos;re wrong?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I urge you to look it up on the internet to hear his response,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and to see what a being hoping to help the world grow really looks like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;One of the most heartbreakingly powerful things that comes to my mind in regards to his work,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is him visiting a school where &lt;a href=\&#34;https://youtu.be/uQ7GvwUsJ7w?t=3450\&#34;&gt;children are being indoctrinated into the belief that Noah and his Ark are absolutely real&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;These children can&amp;apos;t know otherwise,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it becomes their very reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

             <p class="card-text small">If something is wrong somewhere,
you are not the only one to care.

There are others that will fight beside you,
so as long as your cause is just and true.

Some will fight by subtle analogy,
learn from them, and their lack of apology.

Speaking out will set you free,
even though many will come to disagree.

Our lives are unfortunately much too short,
but good things will come and you&#39;ll find comfort.

We are afforded a handful of miracles,
and those certainly will aid to your cause.

Most importantly...</p>
