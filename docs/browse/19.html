it is a way to self evaluate.

If you continue being unable to write,
then it means you are surrounded by invisible walls.

Being able to lay down your favorite thoughts on a piece of paper,
and helping to inspire or enlighten someone, is a sign of health and inner-freedom, and in some cases Greatness.

There are many styles of writing,
and many directions.

My style of writing is patterned after poems,
