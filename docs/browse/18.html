and where life is very, very, very, very, long.

As it winds along the well worn paths like a little song,
and where there is always a right, that can fix a wrong.

And we are hardly ever alone, so as long as we stand strong,
and you can achieve anything so as long as your effort is lifelong.

Many others traveled all these sandy roads,
many handled much more weight and greater workloads.

But it really all revolves about how much you learn, love, and know,

Even without an enemy, we fall into the trap of unknowing, all on our own,
..and we make, what we discover later on to be, wrong decisions.

While we are making those decisions,
we are certainly making them with goodness in mind,
but without knowledge, good intentions may indeed, pave a way to hell.

             <p class="card-text small">There are tipping points in your intellectual development,
where you go from careful observation to certainty of knowing.

You build one thing on top of the other,
it becomes your Temple of Knowledge.

If you are correct about it all,
then the more you add the more you understand.

To learn for real,
we need fascination.

And we need freedom to move between curiosities,
and there are no divisions of subjects here.

We may learn numbers from calculating how many potential exoplanets our radio signals...</p>

             <p class="card-text small">The only thing keeping us back, is lack of wisdom,
this is occurring because the world places no emphasis on becoming wise.

Without wisdom we can&#39;t even tell if education is real or not,
...the mark of a real education are real results.

Without wisdom we can&#39;t tell what real results even are,
without wisdom we begin repeating old mistakes.

People say fake news - nope,
but it is actually the fake education...

Real education, helps a person become Wise and Noble,
Triumphant, Successful, Strong...</p>
