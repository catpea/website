             <p class="card-text small">Don&#39;t aim at success.
The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it.
For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one&#39;s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one&#39;s surrender to a person other than oneself.
Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it.

I want you to listen to what your conscience commands...</p>

There is no clearer\n    aim than becoming a Business Creator, and escaping poverty.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Rising to no end in sight. Eventually leaving a worthy legacy. Unbreakable\n    shoulders for other giants to stand on.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The cure for poverty bears the same pattern as the cure for broken\n    education.

Oh, there will never be enough of those; and there is already far\n    too many.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Pretending to be wise and authentic is far too easy, to put the future of\n    humanity in someone else&amp;#39;s hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Even if it wasn&amp;#39;t a fantasy aimed to place responsibility for education\n    elsewhere, there is no good reason to wait for Policy Makers to update\n    policy.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We must teach children that they are responsible for their own education,\n    and their own exit from poverty, by means of becoming a business creator.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Children need an aim, before they open the textbook.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;They need persistent enlightenment. Not moronic excuses that they won&amp;#39;t\n    always have a calculator at hand, or sick fantasies of a happy job they\n    will always love performing.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t need better teachers, we need and endless supply of Brilliant and\n    Unstoppable Students who accept the responsibility for their own education,\n    at their own pace, and a sequence that matches who they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Unbreakable, Unstoppable, Uncontainable, Unpredictable, Uncontrollable\n    torrent of Superheros under the banner of Unrelenting Pursuit of Excellence\n    and Love of Wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;header&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;My path out of poverty by Lashon Amado&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;/header&gt;\n  &lt;figure&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpaFX6Ei0nU\&#34; class=\&#34;no-tufte-underline\&#34; title=\&#34;My path out of poverty by Lashon Amado\&#34;&gt;\n      &lt;img src=\&#34;/image/yid-CpaFX6Ei0nU.jpg\&#34; alt=\&#34;My path out of poverty by Lashon Amado\&#34; style=\&#34;width: 100%; height: auto;\&#34;&gt;\n    &lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;figcaption&gt;My path out of poverty by Lashon Amado&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpaFX6Ei0nU\&#34; title=\&#34;My path out of poverty by Lashon Amado\&#34;&gt;Play Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;header&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Each a Superhero&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;/header&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Grades must end, because too many children confuse their grade point\n    average with their value to the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The only reason why someone would ever fail a test, is because the wisdom\n    they already had, was incompatible with what was being taught.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;To force incompatible knowledge on someone, and blame them for not\n    integrating it, is evil.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If you are young and still in school. Begin making unbreakable promises\n    that you will fix what is broken. Help your friends to Audio Books that set\n    them free to understand Science, or travel the Appalachian Trail when\n    waiting for the bus. Help them understand YCombinator and Techstars,\n    Startup Accelerators, Angel Funds.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And if you have already left it all behind, now it is time to remember your\n    hopes and dreams. Go back with your wisdom of today, and fix what was\n    broken when you were little. Stand up in the classroom and rage against\n    mediocrity or lies. Take a lesson from Erica Goldson.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;header&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Erica Goldson Valedictorian Speech&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;/header&gt;\n  &lt;figure&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts\&#34; class=\&#34;no-tufte-underline\&#34; title=\&#34;Erica Goldson Valedictorian Speech\&#34;&gt;\n      &lt;img src=\&#34;/image/yid-9M4tdMsg3ts.jpg\&#34; alt=\&#34;Erica Goldson Valedictorian Speech\&#34; style=\&#34;width: 100%; height: auto;\&#34;&gt;\n    &lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;figcaption&gt;Erica Goldson Valedictorian Speech&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts\&#34; title=\&#34;Erica Goldson Valedictorian Speech\&#34;&gt;Play Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;header&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Mothers. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;/header&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Education is not the filling of a vessel, but the kindling of a flame.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The cradle of education is within. The flame of curiosity, lives within.\n    Students reach out and put things into their soul, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes all it takes is a poem.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the explanation, that all education is really for, is beating\n    back Poverty of Mind-and-Wallet.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Poverty that they were unfortunately and unfairly dropped into, and now\n    they must learn wisdom and fight their way out of, and if they so choose,\n    bring back the light so that others may follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And later, finally, enjoy their existence and high achievement, leave a\n    legacy worthy of following.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Never tell a child that life is not fair. That will only force them into\n    accepting their poverty as a given, and your mediocrity as a fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Education is never! for good grades, or a good resume, or a good job that\n    pays well.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Education is for the opposite of Memorization and Servitude.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Education is for Creativity, and Freedom.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Education is for Originality, and Independence.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Education is for Unbrekability, and Leadership.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The children you taught to wait for Superman, are, that promise, and the\n    future, and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And the opposite of high achievement is not failing while daring greatly.\n    Failure is nonsense, just another excuse not to try. There is no such thing\n    as failure. Every step forward adds to success.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;header&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Greta Thunberg&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;/header&gt;\n  &lt;figure&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMrtLsQbaok\&#34; class=\&#34;no-tufte-underline\&#34; title=\&#34;Greta Thunberg\&#34;&gt;\n      &lt;img src=\&#34;/image/yid-TMrtLsQbaok.jpg\&#34; alt=\&#34;Greta Thunberg\&#34; style=\&#34;width: 100%; height: auto;\&#34;&gt;\n    &lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;figcaption&gt;Greta Thunberg&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMrtLsQbaok\&#34; title=\&#34;Greta Thunberg\&#34;&gt;Play Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

             <p class="card-text small">Go placidly amid the noise and haste,
and remember what peace there may be in silence.
As far as possible without surrender
be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly;
and listen to others,
even the dull and the ignorant;
they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons,
they are vexations to the spirit.
If you compare yourself with others,
you may become vain and bitter;
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements...</p>
