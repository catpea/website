             <p class="card-text small">The present belongs to the current generation,
therefore the current generations can be said to be the most important.

Much is to be said on the subject of the great mistakes of the most recent century,
and just as importantly much is to be said about the mistakes we are repeating.

History books are waiting to be read,
they will help us understand current events across all nations.

To correct things, however,
is much more difficult.

This is because we were born into the world long after things were...</p>

is a broken world full of dark secrets.

The world can&#39;t progress forward,
if we are not learning.

Observations are very important,
but they are not on a large enough scale.

We need a steady stream from multiple reinforcing sources,
Audio Books and Lectures are exactly that kind of stream.

They are integrated works of art,
tightly compressed, well arranged.

If you are lucky it will be read by the author,
the chapters will flow together with feeling, pride and joy.
