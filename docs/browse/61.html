when liars take to power; the honest become powerful.

When we face impossible problems,
someone will remind us; all human problems have human solutions.

When governments become too complex,
the Congress will call on you to help them regain their vision.

When liars start winning all the battles,
your wisdom will become even more precious.

It is really important to question everything,
all the Sciences were born this way.

The sciences are a product of the Scientific Principle,
a product of the search for truth by means of real evidence, clear thinking and healthy skepticism.

Our world is changing very quickly,

Previous generations discovered many wrongs,
Wars, Racism, Inequality, Lack of Education.

Due to ineffective schooling and resulting lack of education,
we continue repeating mistakes of previous generations.

The primary cause to repetitions of mistakes and their re-emergence,
is lack of real education that grants the student knowledge, independence, wisdom, and eventual greatness.
