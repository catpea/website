        <p>We often think of consequences to mistakes,<br>
          but consequence does not pick.</p>
        <p>So as long as we keep to our paths,<br>
          all our actions cast changes ahead.</p>
        <p>In mistakes, lessons await,<br>
          in good deeds, we find family.</p>
        <p>In great adventure, we&apos;ll find mountains,<br>
          in great achievements, calm and peace.</p>
        <p>In darkness, we will find light,<br>
          in isolation, we&apos;ll find hugs.</p>
        <p>So as long as we keep to our paths.<br>
          what we shall find will make us stronger.</p><br>
        <p>However, if we dare so to diverge,<br>
          all we have cast we&apos;ll be lost.</p>
        <p>Perhaps no shadows, but certainly no light,<br>
          no lessons, no sweetness, no might.</p>
        <p>By switching paths we&apos;ll find fewer wisdoms,<br>
          and far more things that don&apos;t fit us.</p>
        <p>We&apos;ll also find a force of opposition,<br>
          it will keep our minds tired.</p>
        <p>It will be unclear why life seems strange,<br>
          why everything takes so much more to see.</p>
        <p>Why we seem to lack confidence,<br>
          or how everyone else has so much of it.</p><br>
        <p>But, the most troubling thing, my Dear Friends,<br>
          is in how easy it is to diverge.</p>
        <p>There is a place for Leaps of Faith in life,<br>
          they are quite sacred, and as beautiful.</p>
        <p>But, to fill in a stranger&apos;s blanks,<br>
          or trust that the others know what they are doing.</p>
        <p>To listen to good advice that considers you naught,<br>
          or give something up of your self, and not know why.</p>
        <p>To go to a place because everyone went there,<br>
          to bow because all others bowed.</p>
        <p>That is not sacred, sacrilegious maybe,<br>
          you must never follow, you must always lead.</p><br>
        <p>Even more troubling is how it all collapses,<br>
          not with a bang, but a stupid sick whimper:</p>
        <p>&quot;How were they supposed to know&quot;,<br>
          &quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;</p>
        <p>All the blame for what others did,<br>
          to Your Sacred Self, somehow falls back right on you.</p>
        <p>And then it turns out,<br>
          your lesson is all over cheap paperbacks.</p>
        <p>Everyone has been trough this,<br>
          and none were the wiser.</p>
        <p>All those confident faces and smiles, were faked,<br>
          and the more convincing they try to be, the less they are in pain.</p><br>
        <p>When someone is putting you at risk,<br>
          take a split second to imagine them saying:</p>
        <p>&quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;, and stand your ground.<br>
          You are not to follow, you are to lead.</p>
        <p>Let them have have their stupid games, and drinks, temporary junk,<br>
          you go to the DIA, take some notes, and splurge on clay.</p>
        <p>Find a gallery worthy of your works,<br>
          resume where Rodin left off.</p>
        <p>Instead of filling the blanks,<br>
          show the world the shapes.</p>
        <p>How can your other half recognize you,<br>
          when you are traveling on some other path.</p><br>
        <p>What you many not do, is to start at the bottom,<br>
          all those cheap novels, they describe starting at the zero.</p>
        <p>Start where all the heroes left off,<br>
          read a handful of novels, and move on to their Memoirs.</p>
        <p>Your life depends on knowing what it is and where to start,<br>
          and what to avoid.</p>
        <p>It will get lonely, yes.<br>
          You&apos;ll be lonely because you don&apos;t drink, and don&apos;t do stupid things.</p>
        <p>You&apos;ll be lonely, but, You&apos;ll be You,<br>
          you will shine your own light, and. you. will. be. seen.</p><br>
        <p>Get up, step up,<br>
          create and speak with art, and you&apos;ll talk with the world.</p>
        <p>Grab pencils, trace with an Office Projector,<br>
          and bring your Tortillon along.</p>
        <p>At the gym, dance,<br>
          your way is the only way.</p>
        <p>You may get lonely,<br>
          but for long.</p><br>
        <p>Try to help people learn, what you have learned,<br>
          become an assistant, a tutor, and a substitute teacher.</p>
        <p>Keep track of your Peace Corps application,<br>
          just keep adding to it, keep re-sending it.</p>
        <p>They probably don&apos;t read it until version 50, anyway.<br>
          It gives you time to revise and refine the ideas.</p>
        <p>To begin walking your own path,<br>
          is to enter, The Grand Path of Pursuits of Excellence.</p>
        <p>Everything on your own path will add to you,<br>
          there will be no limit to how far you can travel.</p><br>
        <p>Stay on your own path, avoid generic advice, read Memoirs,<br>
          keep moving up, and always try to move faster.</p>
        <p>Learn about new things,<br>
          expand your knowledge, every day.</p>
        <p>If it is something you don&apos;t understand,<br>
          find an Audiobook about it.</p>
        <p>Stay sharp, stay fit,<br>
          endurance training goes well with Audiobooks, and Love of Wisdom.</p>
        <p>Others must have no influence on you,<br>
          this is not their life, it is your life.</p>
        <p>Move at your own pace, and in your own sequence,<br>
          make your 90 old self laugh, at how amazing you are.</p>
