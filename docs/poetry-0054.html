        <p>If you want change, you can&apos;t continue doing the same things you&apos;ve always done.<br>
          If you really want change, then you are going to have to alter your course, now.</p>
        <p>If you don&apos;t fight back, you will always lose,<br>
          and if you stay in the dark, you will only add to the darkness.</p>
        <p>There cannot be a compromise between good and evil,<br>
          a compromise only takes from the good, and only give s to the evil.</p>
        <p>Your office window, is not a substitute for a Call to the Wild,<br>
          Your next promotion does not actually make you a greater person.</p>
        <p>A vacation, cannot set you free, it is not a substitute for nature.<br>
          Dressing beautifully, has never made a person truly beautiful.</p>
        <p>Waiting for that perfect someone, will not help them notice you.<br>
          Trusting that someone else will help you, is just another delay.</p>
        <p>And just getting out there, is not enough to be understood.<br>
          And going out, following friends, can only put you on somebody else&apos;s path.</p>
        <p>Life is not hard, it only gets complicated when you follow,<br>
          because by following you just end up in places you don&apos;t understand.</p>
        <p>You must lead. And you must keep walking forward. Your own step, after your own step.<br>
          In your own direction, towards the things that move you, only then can You be Trully Moved.</p>
        <p>It must the correct combination of books, poems, steps, events, summers, and epochs.<br>
          Do not try to hurry, do not change roads, only move up, only think, and envision, and grow.</p>
        <p>That which leads to Your Greatness, to Your Freedom, to Your Nature, requires, Truth.<br>
          Walk your own path at your own pace. Only the correct key, can set your mind free.</p>
        <p>The others who seem to have it all right.<br>
          Often get lost on alien paths, and merely put on a happy face.</p>
        <p>While it seems like you are trapped today, you are not, it is just an illusion.<br>
          Look towards the car keys.</p>
        <p>That is all it will take. Grab the keys and go.<br>
          It will be very difficult at first.</p>
        <p>The toxic build up that is keeping you from getting up, right now,<br>
          takes three days to crumble. It is a heavy cage.</p>
        <p>But there is a way.<br>
          A simple way.</p>
        <p>Grab the keys, and go... i275 south, merge onto 75 south,<br>
          and take it all the way down... Florida Keys, US Highway One.</p>
        <p>If you live in Florida, then you are headed for Michigan&apos;s Upper Peninsula.<br>
          If you live West, your destination is all the way East.</p>
        <p>It is not the destination, it is the Journey, my Friend.<br>
          Take your time, watch the cage crumble and fade as you go.</p>
        <p>Only the important things, will stay.<br>
          And you&apos;ll get to see yourself again.</p>
        <p>And you&apos;ll get to be free again,<br>
          you will resume where you left of.</p>
        <p>A life of bondage,<br>
          is not worthy of you.</p>
        <p>Life is not meant to be a cage, or cruel, or frighten you.<br>
          You knew this as a child, and you let that slip away, not even noticing when it went.</p>
        <p>It is your Right to resist being pushed into places that you don&apos;t want to be in.<br>
          It is your Right to reject conditions that you never agreed to, that you were pushed into.</p>
        <p>How else can the Universe be worthy of us, how else can our lives be beautiful.<br>
          Heaven and Paradise are real, but they are now, right now. Now.</p>
        <p>How can people love you, when your own love for yourself is slipping away.<br>
          You have to. You have to accept the responsibility for your Health, and Dignity.</p>
        <p>You don&apos;t have to make it all the way, the first time,<br>
          and you don&apos;t have to leave your phone behind.</p>
        <p>You can call this therapy, or a vision quest, you can call it a road trip.<br>
          You are not allowed to live in a cage, of whatever constitution, that will make you ill.</p>
        <p>It comes to you naturally to take care of your body,<br>
          but your mind also requires care.</p>
        <p>When you reach your Freedom, you&apos;ll know what to do next,<br>
          it can be another trip, East, or West.</p>
        <p>If you feel trapped, the Universe is darker for it.<br>
          Take a week. Or two. Forty days is best. call it your Quarantine.</p>
        <p>Unless you clear you mind, and focus on what is important,<br>
          on you and those worthy of your care, you will lose it.</p>
        <p>You will forget the beautiful person you truly are,<br>
          you will fall from heaven, and forget about paradise.</p>
        <p>And life will turn into a black and white TV show.<br>
          You must take good care of your mind.</p>
        <p>If there is no one else that cares about you,<br>
          then look at this poem.</p>
        <p>I care.<br>
          Hi!</p>
        <p>I am, speaking for you!<br>
          grab the keys, or bicycle, or comfy shoes, and go.</p>
        <p>Go, and never again, let go.</p>
        <p>Your health is important.<br>
          Your well being is important.</p>
        <p>A Human Being is Meant to Learn,<br>
          A Human Being is Meant to Rise.</p>
        <p>You are meant to filled with Wisdom,<br>
          with Joy and Love of Life.</p>
        <p>You are meant to Laugh,<br>
          Truly Fully Laugh.</p>
        <p>Listen to me, there is more.<br>
          You Are Meant To Become A Great Being.</p>
