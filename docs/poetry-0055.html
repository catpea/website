          <p>There is a very special group of people, that many have forgotten,<br>
            our Intellectual Foremothers and Forefathers.</p>
          <p>They brings us gifts wrapped in the primitive art of writing text, on paper.<br>
            It is frequently all they had, it was the only way to reach us.</p>
          <p>They are brilliant, and healthy, and unbroken, and triumphant,<br>
            they are full of light, more than history will ever tell us.</p>
          <p>Nobody who outlives an empire, will have their history shown for the lovely thing it was.<br>
            This served to protect them, and it failed to erase them.</p>
          <p>We must never allow ourselves to merely listen to history,<br>
            because those are always writ by prevalent powers, it was their job to erase them.</p>
          <p>More modern Philosophers had the same problem,<br>
            Our friend, Dear Friedrich, and what a Warrior...</p>
          <p>Was smeared by the Nazis, he was so powerful, that everyone wanted a piece of his might.<br>
            Friedrich Nietzsche hated what Nazis stood for.</p>
          <p>Recently, one of the Great Modern Philosophers was under attack, it deeply hurt and frightened her,<br>
            but her classrooms rose for her with noting but love and continued admiration.</p>
          <p>We are tasked with bringing the light of our hearts, and resurrecting those who passed,<br>
            not by merely understanding their books, but by understanding what they were trying to say.</p>
          <p>And it is OK, to understand them in our own way at first,<br>
            it takes time, to befriend someone, from a book, across time.</p>
          <p>Yes, all we have to go on, is text on paper.<br>
            But we know they were just like us, they were All Too Human, friendly, and of good cheer.</p>
          <p>If they made mistakes, these Great Beings were not stained for long,<br>
            they rose, and they took their miserable failures, to create gifts of prevention for us.</p>
          <p>These gifts are complex, they are as complex and nuanced as You and I.<br>
            It takes hard work to inherit gifts this powerful.</p>
          <p>The only way to unwrap those Gifts of Wisdom is with Admiration, Friendship and Love,<br>
            schools teach us to see Great Beings as these synthetic monoliths of concrete.</p>
          <p>But nothing could be further from the truth, because all these Great Beings,<br>
            they were once kids, and teenagers, they had heartaches, dreams and hopes.</p>
          <p>They were just like you and I, but they invented ideas that they cared to share,<br>
            and they rose to the challenges of leadership to preserve them.</p>
          <p>Those ideas are our intellectual inheritance,<br>
            here is my attempt to name a few for your pleasure.</p>
