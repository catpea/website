    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Becoming a Web Developer is like fighting in a Great Battle.</p>
      <p>If you make a wrong move, <strong>you will lose</strong>, but gain wisdom for it, with
        each failure you gain more wisdom, with each rebuild, you build faster.</p>
      <p>Things can get toxic all too quickly, you will have to be ready to quit,
        and retry. Like a Samurai, without thought, you release your Katana, cut

      <p>Below is the text from <a href="https://themes.shopify.com/services/themes/guidelines">Love building themes? Join the Theme Store
          community at Shopify</a>, where website themes sell for $180.</p>
      <p>(If you think you can handle this, go for it! Though, please note that they
        are gently asking that you have a team, which could mean outsourcing, and a
        budget for bug fixing. The platform for managing your outsourced team would
        be <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> and <a href="https://slack.com/">slack</a>, this is doable you could even experiment
        paying your developers via <a href="https://liberapay.com/">liberapay</a>)</p>
      <p>Personally, I see that the posting below has too many restrictions. And if
        your theme won&#39;t average 10 sales per month, they&#39;ll throw it out.</p>
      <p>I don&#39;t know what their relationship is with <a href="https://github.com/topics/css">leading web design
          frameworks</a>. I don&#39;t think they have a rational streamlined pipeline.
        Because, what they call bug fixing is a massive undertaking requiring
        <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/graphs/contributors">dozens of developers</a>.</p>
      <p>The most widely developed foundation for themes, after many years of
        development had <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulse/monthly">60 issues</a> last month alone (November 2019).</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">What to Avoid</h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Shopify is the world’s fastest growing commerce platform and we have no
        plans to slow down! The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is on a mission to
        make sure our merchants have access to the highest quality themes
        available. Every month, thousands of merchants look for new themes for
        their online stores. Our team is on the lookout for skilled, passionate
        designers and developers we can work with to create amazing themes for the
        Theme Store.</p>
      <h5 id="important-information-to-know-before-you-apply">Important information to know before you apply</h5>
      <p>Here are a few things to consider before you send us your Theme Partner
        application:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shopify themes need constant care and attention. We expect Theme
          Partners who work with us to be engaged, passionate about their theme(s),
          and apply any theme updates we request in a timely manner.</li>
        <li>Being a Theme Partner is a full-time job. You will need to dedicate a
          lot of time updating your theme(s) as well as supporting the merchants who
          are using your theme. If you become a Theme Partner, you’ll need to
          consider how you’ll balance Theme Partner work with other jobs you are
          currently doing, or are planning to be engaged in.</li>
        <li>Our current Theme Partners are a tight-knit group of people. We expect
          potential Theme Partners to be approachable and collaborative with the
          Shopify Theme Partnerships team, as well as merchants using your theme(s).</li>
        <li>We want Theme Partners to actively contribute to the Shopify themes
          ecosystem, and work with us to help merchants succeed. The Theme
          Partnerships team will be working closely with you every step of the way
          during the theme submission process, and will continue to work closely with
          you once your theme is published. We have dedicated email and Slack
          channels set up to provide feedback, advice and support for all your
          theme-related questions and issues.</li>
        <li>The revenue share for Theme Partners is 70/30. The Theme Partner
          receives 70% of each theme sale.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5 id="what-to-submit-when-you-apply">What to submit when you apply</h5>
      <p>Please email themes@shopify.com and include all of the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A link to an active Shopify website you built for a client. This must
          be a live, fully functioning shop that you built for a client.</li>
        <li>A case study for the above Shopify website that details your
          experiences on the project. You will need to provide an overview of the
          project and the client.</li>
        <li>A cover letter.</li>
        <li>A link to your design portfolio.</li>
      </ol>
      <h5 id="how-we-review-your-application">How we review your application</h5>
      <p>For the <strong>active Shopify website</strong> our review will cover:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Problem solving ability (the solution outlined in the case study is
          visible).</li>
        <li>Originality (the shop is using a custom theme, not a free or paid theme
          from the Shopify Theme Store).</li>
        <li>Art direction (choice of photography, images, icons, color, and overall
          originality).</li>
        <li>Layout (flow of content, hierarchy, balance, contrast, white space,
          responsiveness, grid, and alignment).</li>
        <li>Typography (font pairings, font sizes, line spacing, hierarchy of text,
          number of fonts used, and legibility of text).</li>
        <li>Consistency in design patterns (between pages and on a single page).</li>
        <li>Accessibility (hover states, colour ratios, and touch targets).</li>
        <li>Customer UX (purchase flow through the collection, product, and cart
          pages).</li>
        <li>Technical ability (up-to-date with Shopify platform, website
          functionality, code consistency, and lack of errors).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For the <strong>case study</strong> we will be looking for you to provide this
        information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What brought the client to you?</li>
        <li>What were the client’s needs?</li>
        <li>How did you go about solving their problem?</li>
        <li>We would like to see your research, your workflow (prototyping and
          refining), and what you learned.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For the <strong>cover letter</strong> we would like to see the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An outline of who you (and your team) are.</li>
        <li>Why you want to join the Shopify Theme Partner community?</li>
        <li>Why you think you’d do well as a Theme Partner?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Feel free to put your own personal touch or spin on the cover letter. We
        highly value originality, enthusiasm, and motivation when considering
        applications.</p>
      <p>For the <strong>design portfolio</strong> we will be reviewing the same design related
        points as mentioned above for the active Shopify website:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Art direction.</li>
        <li>Layout.</li>
        <li>Typography.</li>
        <li>Consistency.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is not able to provide detailed
        feedback on why an application does not pass our review process. If we do
        reach out to you about becoming a potential Theme Partner, we will work
        with you on the next steps of the approval process.</p>
      <h5 id="your-theme-in-the-shopify-theme-store">Your theme in the Shopify Theme Store</h5>
      <p>Once a theme has been built and approved, it may only be distributed via
        the Theme Store. Please do not distribute your theme on other marketplaces
        or third-party channels, or try to take customers away from the Theme Store.</p>
      <h5 id="theme-support">Theme support</h5>
      <p>If there is a technical issue with your theme (for example: broken layout,
        dead link, logic error) you will be responsible for fixing the issue in a
        timely fashion. Critical bugs must be fixed immediately or your theme may
        be temporarily removed from the Theme Store.</p>
      <p>Theme Partners are responsible for supporting merchants who use their
        theme(s). You will need to provide a public support email address, theme
        documentation, and assist merchants with their theme-related questions.</p>
      <p>Themes will be removed from the Theme Store if they have made less than 25
        sales in a 3 month time period. Theme Partners are responsible for keeping
        their themes up-to-date with core Shopify features and any improved
        standards Shopify implements in the future. These can include improvements
        to the overall user experience, the user interface, accessibility, and more.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">The Challenge</h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Now, a job making themes for Shopify is great for a Web Design start-up
        struggling to get customers, as 160 sales would get them $20K, after the
        30% cut (of $8,640). But for an outsider looking in, it is just a look into
        the world of professional web development, and never-ending bug fixing.
        Aside from regular bugs, both code-bases (bootstrap and shopify) are under
        active development, that is a lot of code updates.</p>
      <p>There is a smaller but streamlined theme sales platform, with <a href="https://support.wrapbootstrap.com/help/submission-guidelines-themes-and-templates">more
          reasonable restrictions</a>. Take a look at the sales stats that they
        parade right at their <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">front page</a>. At 48,623 sales priced at $44 USD,
        the <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S">INSPINIA - Responsive Admin Theme</a> would have made 2.2 million USD.
        Even if WrapBootstrap took 50% of that, the developer took a million home.</p>
      <p>Now remember <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S">INSPINIA</a> is sitting right on top of <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> so
        <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulse">all this development is going on in the back</a> at no charge to <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/user/WebAppLayers">INSPINIA
          Developers</a>. All they do is add more components, and keep up with the
        latest updates to the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> code base.</p>

      <p>The Web Developer, that you need to become creates the streamlined,

        or even <a href="https://shopify.com/">shopify.com</a> it self, and others that tickle your fancy in
        similar ways.</p>
      <p>Now when I went to the website of INSPINIA developers, I got redirected to
        wrapbootstrap.com. This may mean - and in deed it would make perfect sense</p>
      <ul>
        <li>that WrapBootstrap made INSPINIA. This would also mean that they made 2.2

      <p>Your story may be even more elaborate than this. You maybe taking a step

    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Web Developer, is a huge step. But making themes is not it. It is not even
        about learning programming, though you should definitely know about it;
        because you need a team of programmers to develop your sales platform(s).</p>
      <p>It is about becoming a Businessperson with a plan. In other words, a
        Founder, a CEO.</p>
      <p>You shouldn&#39;t think of a web developer as a person that merely develops for
        the web, think of one as a developer of the web. That is a difference
        between $180 and $2,200,000, a resume and an outstanding portfolio, an
        employee and an employer, bugfixes and excitement.</p>
