    <h5 class="card-title">Poverty Of Mind Comes From Lack Of Non Cognitive Skills</h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Dan Cardinali&#39;s definition of Non Cognitive Skills includes the following:
        Building grit, and resilience, and persistence, and self-regulation. He&#39;s
        describing skills of a Warrior, a Fighter, an Authentic Grown Up.</p>
      <p>Dan Cardinali explains that ideally families should provide Non Cognitive
        Skills (Child Development), and then schools will deliver Academic
        Development (Math, History, Physics).</p>
      <p>But this is not how it works today, well to do parents are too busy,
        parents stricken by poverty can&#39;t have time, and non-cognitive skill
        development is not only unavailable, but is often laughed at by teachers
        &quot;Parents do your job.&quot; they brainlessly utter.</p>
      <p>Above all, a child born to the culture of poverty (lacking non-cognitive
        skills) will often remain in the culture of poverty be it dropping out or
        graduation. The steps out and up are just too far apart.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">The Battle Against Poverty of Mind</h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>It is correct to say that Poverty of Mind is rooted in lack of Non
        Cognitive Skills.</p>
      <p>An example of poverty of mind is inability to have an expensive lunch with
        an internship company CEO. Out of fear of not knowing <strong>EVERYTHING!</strong> from
        how to get a table to when to order, or even if it is OK to just have the
        cute little bagel and focus on the questionnaire. Lunch, if not impossible,
        can be impossibly terrifying.</p>
      <p>There is no breaking out of poverty when every-step induces fear,
        confusion, anxiety.</p>
      <p>To be clear, the ultimate aim for both Student and Principal. Almost
        always, is to rise and break away, become a CEO.</p>
      <p>Become an inspiration and a teacher; to make life more. To then retire come
        the Golden Age of Wisdom and write. Write about the lessons that counted to
        make them last even longer. Create an Audio Book in your own voice in hopes
        of it being used 50 years from now to Rise &amp; Learn to Really Learn. What an
        Honor to have your spirit revived by means of Admiration and Love, your own
        voice across decades, maybe centuries, maybe forever.</p>
      <p>Instead, the children are getting scared, mostly because they can see
        schools are forcing irrelevant learning that fades away. It is impossible
        to retain irrelevant knowledge. In context of education, forcing irrelevant
        knowledge and grading a student down for lack of retention is evil.</p>
      <p>And here the child does not want the job because it has too many
        complications, can&#39;t even have the internship lunch because it is too
        terrifying, and can&#39;t conceive of the notion of connecting with the CEO in
        such a way as to eventually resign position and start a company in a
        similar sector.</p>
      <p>They are scared, sometimes crushed, but far too brave to show you...
        Principal.</p>
      <p>We know what happens to most young people that can&#39;t handle fear or
        depression.</p>

        culture and bad ideas.</p>

      <p>What can be easier than to help a child grow?</p>
      <p>what can be more rewarding than to be Admired, Loved, Remembered? To have a
        High School named after you upon your retirement, and have every student

    <h5 class="card-title">A Meaningful Life Calls For Real Education</h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Focus on Real Education, not Administration. If you need money, then look
        to your students.</p>
      <p>Become a Start-up Accelerator. Give them initial mentoring and funding,
        Take a small percentage of their earnings in return for the initial funding
        and in order to fund other start-ups. Take only for a small number of
        years, and only what you need. Get out of their way.</p>
      <p>Never forget, Principal. You serve The Kids, The Students, they are the
        point of it all, they are the future. The Children are not your means to
        staying in business and getting paid- that would make you a Monster and a
        Fraud.</p>
      <p>The best way to fight poverty in a person&#39;s mind, is to set a student up
        for a job so high up, that it will make them want to run out of the school
        quietly-yelling and hope they never need to come back.</p>
      <p>A prestigious position at a local Hospital as a Research Nurse that keeps
        everyone informed a month ahead of time, a complicated job at the Library
        of Congress, or as Someone Amazing at the Detroit Institute of Arts.</p>
      <p>Set a step so high, that it is already a healthy career but completely
        unreachable to the child, the step up being, Just Impossible. And then
        slowly, build. But smaller steps, and maybe even smaller, or maybe even an
        on-ramp for a smooth ride.</p>
