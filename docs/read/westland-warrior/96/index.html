    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Becoming a Web Developer is like fighting in a Great Battle.</p>
      <p>If you make a wrong move, <strong>you will lose</strong>, but gain wisdom for it, with<br>each failure you gain more wisdom, with each rebuild, you build faster.</p>
      <p>Things can get toxic all too quickly, you will have to be ready to quit,<br>and retry. Like a Samurai, without thought, you release your Katana, cut<br>the job, move on.</p>

      <p>Below is the text from <a href="https://themes.shopify.com/services/themes/guidelines">Love building themes? Join the Theme Store<br>community at Shopify</a>, where website themes sell for $180.</p>
      <p>(If you think you can handle this, go for it! Though, please note that they<br>are gently asking that you have a team, which could mean outsourcing, and a<br>budget for bug fixing. The platform for managing your outsourced team would<br>be <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> and <a href="https://slack.com/">slack</a>, this is doable you could even experiment<br>paying your developers via <a href="https://liberapay.com/">liberapay</a>)</p>
      <p>Personally, I see that the posting below has too many restrictions. And if<br>your theme won&#39;t average 10 sales per month, they&#39;ll throw it out.</p>
      <p>I don&#39;t know what their relationship is with <a href="https://github.com/topics/css">leading web design<br>frameworks</a>. I don&#39;t think they have a rational streamlined pipeline.<br>Because, what they call bug fixing is a massive undertaking requiring<br><a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/graphs/contributors">dozens of developers</a>.</p>
      <p>The most widely developed foundation for themes, after many years of<br>development had <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulse/monthly">60 issues</a> last month alone (November 2019).</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">What to Avoid</h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Shopify is the world’s fastest growing commerce platform and we have no<br>plans to slow down! The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is on a mission to<br>make sure our merchants have access to the highest quality themes<br>available. Every month, thousands of merchants look for new themes for<br>their online stores. Our team is on the lookout for skilled, passionate<br>designers and developers we can work with to create amazing themes for the<br>Theme Store.</p>
      <h5 id="important-information-to-know-before-you-apply">Important information to know before you apply</h5>
      <p>Here are a few things to consider before you send us your Theme Partner<br>application:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Shopify themes need constant care and attention. We expect Theme<br>Partners who work with us to be engaged, passionate about their theme(s),<br>and apply any theme updates we request in a timely manner.</li>
        <li> Being a Theme Partner is a full-time job. You will need to dedicate a<br>lot of time updating your theme(s) as well as supporting the merchants who<br>are using your theme. If you become a Theme Partner, you’ll need to<br>consider how you’ll balance Theme Partner work with other jobs you are<br>currently doing, or are planning to be engaged in.</li>
        <li> Our current Theme Partners are a tight-knit group of people. We expect<br>potential Theme Partners to be approachable and collaborative with the<br>Shopify Theme Partnerships team, as well as merchants using your theme(s).</li>
        <li> We want Theme Partners to actively contribute to the Shopify themes<br>ecosystem, and work with us to help merchants succeed. The Theme<br>Partnerships team will be working closely with you every step of the way<br>during the theme submission process, and will continue to work closely with<br>you once your theme is published. We have dedicated email and Slack<br>channels set up to provide feedback, advice and support for all your<br>theme-related questions and issues.</li>
        <li> The revenue share for Theme Partners is 70/30. The Theme Partner<br>receives 70% of each theme sale.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5 id="what-to-submit-when-you-apply">What to submit when you apply</h5>
      <p>Please email themes@shopify.com and include all of the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> A link to an active Shopify website you built for a client. This must<br>be a live, fully functioning shop that you built for a client.</li>
        <li> A case study for the above Shopify website that details your<br>experiences on the project. You will need to provide an overview of the<br>project and the client.</li>
        <li> A cover letter.</li>
        <li> A link to your design portfolio.</li>
      </ol>
      <h5 id="how-we-review-your-application">How we review your application</h5>
      <p>For the <strong>active Shopify website</strong> our review will cover:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Problem solving ability (the solution outlined in the case study is<br>visible).</li>
        <li> Originality (the shop is using a custom theme, not a free or paid theme<br>from the Shopify Theme Store).</li>
        <li> Art direction (choice of photography, images, icons, color, and overall<br>originality).</li>
        <li> Layout (flow of content, hierarchy, balance, contrast, white space,<br>responsiveness, grid, and alignment).</li>
        <li> Typography (font pairings, font sizes, line spacing, hierarchy of text,<br>number of fonts used, and legibility of text).</li>
        <li> Consistency in design patterns (between pages and on a single page).</li>
        <li> Accessibility (hover states, colour ratios, and touch targets).</li>
        <li> Customer UX (purchase flow through the collection, product, and cart<br>pages).</li>
        <li> Technical ability (up-to-date with Shopify platform, website<br>functionality, code consistency, and lack of errors).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For the <strong>case study</strong> we will be looking for you to provide this<br>information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> What brought the client to you?</li>
        <li> What were the client’s needs?</li>
        <li> How did you go about solving their problem?</li>
        <li> We would like to see your research, your workflow (prototyping and<br>refining), and what you learned.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For the <strong>cover letter</strong> we would like to see the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> An outline of who you (and your team) are.</li>
        <li> Why you want to join the Shopify Theme Partner community?</li>
        <li> Why you think you’d do well as a Theme Partner?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Feel free to put your own personal touch or spin on the cover letter. We<br>highly value originality, enthusiasm, and motivation when considering<br>applications.</p>
      <p>For the <strong>design portfolio</strong> we will be reviewing the same design related<br>points as mentioned above for the active Shopify website:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Art direction.</li>
        <li> Layout.</li>
        <li> Typography.</li>
        <li> Consistency.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is not able to provide detailed<br>feedback on why an application does not pass our review process. If we do<br>reach out to you about becoming a potential Theme Partner, we will work<br>with you on the next steps of the approval process.</p>
      <h5 id="your-theme-in-the-shopify-theme-store">Your theme in the Shopify Theme Store</h5>
      <p>Once a theme has been built and approved, it may only be distributed via<br>the Theme Store. Please do not distribute your theme on other marketplaces<br>or third-party channels, or try to take customers away from the Theme Store.</p>
      <h5 id="theme-support">Theme support</h5>
      <p>If there is a technical issue with your theme (for example: broken layout,<br>dead link, logic error) you will be responsible for fixing the issue in a<br>timely fashion. Critical bugs must be fixed immediately or your theme may<br>be temporarily removed from the Theme Store.</p>
      <p>Theme Partners are responsible for supporting merchants who use their<br>theme(s). You will need to provide a public support email address, theme<br>documentation, and assist merchants with their theme-related questions.</p>
      <p>Themes will be removed from the Theme Store if they have made less than 25<br>sales in a 3 month time period. Theme Partners are responsible for keeping<br>their themes up-to-date with core Shopify features and any improved<br>standards Shopify implements in the future. These can include improvements<br>to the overall user experience, the user interface, accessibility, and more.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">The Challenge</h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Now, a job making themes for Shopify is great for a Web Design start-up<br>struggling to get customers, as 160 sales would get them $20K, after the<br>30% cut (of $8,640). But for an outsider looking in, it is just a look into<br>the world of professional web development, and never-ending bug fixing.<br>Aside from regular bugs, both code-bases (bootstrap and shopify) are under<br>active development, that is a lot of code updates.</p>
      <p>There is a smaller but streamlined theme sales platform, with <a href="https://support.wrapbootstrap.com/help/submission-guidelines-themes-and-templates">more<br>reasonable restrictions</a>. Take a look at the sales stats that they<br>parade right at their <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">front page</a>. At 48,623 sales priced at $44 USD,<br>the <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S">INSPINIA - Responsive Admin Theme</a> would have made 2.2 million USD.<br>Even if WrapBootstrap took 50% of that, the developer took a million home.</p>
      <p>Now remember <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S">INSPINIA</a> is sitting right on top of <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> so<br><a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulse">all this development is going on in the back</a> at no charge to <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/user/WebAppLayers">INSPINIA<br>Developers</a>. All they do is add more components, and keep up with the<br>latest updates to the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> code base.</p>

      <p>The Web Developer, that you need to become creates the streamlined,<br>low-liability versions of <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com">wrapbootstrap.com</a>, <a href="https://themes.shopify.com/">themes.shopify.com</a>,<br>or even <a href="https://shopify.com/">shopify.com</a> it self, and others that tickle your fancy in<br>similar ways.</p>
      <p>Now when I went to the website of INSPINIA developers, I got redirected to<br>wrapbootstrap.com. This may mean - and in deed it would make perfect sense</p>
      <ul>
        <li>that WrapBootstrap made INSPINIA. This would also mean that they made 2.2<br>Million Dollars, they pocketed 100% of those sales (<a href="https://support.wrapbootstrap.com/help/fee-structure">3rd party sellers earn<br>80%</a>).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your story may be even more elaborate than this. You maybe taking a step<br>above the platforms, and sell a service where a person can rent a platform<br>like <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com">wrapbootstrap.com</a> or <a href="https://themes.shopify.com/">themes.shopify.com</a> for a monthly<br>membership fee and a reasonable percentage of sales.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Become a CEO</h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Web Developer, is a huge step. But making themes is not it. It is not even<br>about learning programming, though you should definitely know about it;<br>because you need a team of programmers to develop your sales platform(s).</p>
      <p>It is about becoming a Businessperson with a plan. In other words, a<br>Founder, a CEO.</p>
      <p>You shouldn&#39;t think of a web developer as a person that merely develops for<br>the web, think of one as a developer of the web. That is a difference<br>between $180 and $2,200,000, a resume and an outstanding portfolio, an<br>employee and an employer, bugfixes and excitement.</p>
