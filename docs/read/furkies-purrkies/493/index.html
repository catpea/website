    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">People often feel like they are not Artists,<br>because if they pick up a pencil only chicken scratch will come out.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But that has nothing to do with being an artist,<br>that is about drawing concepts on paper.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The concept of a nose is the letter L,<br>we must not judge ourselves by the standards of photo-realism when all we know is how to draw like Picasso.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That letter L shaped nose is still very important,<br>a lot of modern business graphics expand on that, plus they heavy rely on very special color schemes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There aren't too many of them,<br>but it takes very little to begin spotting the color trends.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In abstract art, it is not just the nose, an other shapes,<br>but also proportions, some for example like big bodies, small heads, others enlarge the heads, that nose will fit really well.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is important to add color, gradients, of a particular color scheme to your L shaped nose,<br>and practice with a pencil first, fuzz around and dance with it, and try to find your abstract face in the lines that call to you.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is not chicken scratch, it is missing color, gradients,<br>and above all a color palette and strategy for body proportions that you will never change, but always better.</div>

  <div class="section card-body mb-0 my-2">
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A lot of people want to draw like portrait artists,<br>and that is very easy, you take a photo, and then use a projector to project it on paper, or use carbon copy paper.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But your photo has to be good,<br>it has to have the same lighting as Mona Lisa.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">None of the shadows in all the famous portraits and paintings were put there by mistake,<br>those works exist, because an artist discovered the scene.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When someone wants a portrait an artist will place them in special light,<br>your photo needs bright highlights and dark shadows, otherwise you may need to bring the shadows from another photo.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And your photo has to capture the person as they are to you,<br>as you see them best, this will take a goddie long while to set up.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Once you have the photo,<br>prepare for 10 to 100 sketches, some in charcoal, some in pencil, some freehand as you study the eyes maybe.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Maybe keep it all in a large journal or notebook,<br>you may want to hand that in along with your artwork.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And you have to take videos or time laps photographs of your progress,<br>a video of a two hour session where you work on hair and shadows is just as priceless as your final work of art.</div>

<div class="card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow">
  <div class="section card-body mb-0 my-2">
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Once you start outlining where the shadows are with the help of your movie projector, or graphite paper,<br>you leave the world of L shaped noses, and notice, that photo-realism is so unique and precious, that going freehand is a bad idea.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Personally, I once felt it was disrespectful, to create a portrait without all the science in the world,<br>one of my clients requested a drawing of their dad when he was younger, I could not imagine creating something less than perfect.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The client wanted me to capture the youth of their father,<br>it is not good to do that free hand, it had to be perfect, out of respect.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Take your art on adventures, and take photos of things that capture your atention,<br>work on getting the proportions perfect at home by using a projector, and then return to the site to have that live image before you.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was known as the Mona Lisa guy, becasue I liked repeating the same thing in different mediums,<br>and I was learning more and more with each new artwork.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK4Uo5QvH6M">Oil painting is also easy</a>, but you need to sketch out the proper proportions first,<br>then you have to use white and gray to get the shadows perfect, so use a black and white photo for this part.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then you gently add a transparent layer of color,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQYcG4Km1-k">while it is a bit more complex you desaturate colors by mixing them with opposites on the color wheel</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Having a while and black under-painting really helps,<br>but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNB3XY67Q-I">it is the color mixing that oil paintings really benefits from</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The thing about oil paint is that it does not dry very quickly,<br>it gives you the ability to keep tweaking your painting.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Acrylics are another choice,<br>they don't mix anywhere as easy as oils, they just dry.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And watercolors, are wonderful, once you have a sketch,<br>you don't color by mixing a color up and then using that color directly on paper, but you color in layer on really think paper.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In that way Watercolors and Oils give you time to make adjustments and change things,<br>acrylics however, let you easily paint over something you didn't like, they are very opaque.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Always work on a series of portraits on a singe subject,<br>it can be people's portraits, it can be people's pets, or it can be vistas, or just Mona Lisas.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But in the beginning you always have to sketch out the subject with pencils first,<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=pico+mini+projector">there are cheap pico projectors that can connect directly to the phone you snapped a photo with</a>, so it can't be easier.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I have fond memories of drawing a series of Raccoon portraits in my post Mona Lisa phase,<br>I was just using photos from the internet, which is not perfect, because you don't feel connected to the kitty, you have to take your own pictures first.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One time in a coffeehouse, I was approached by a watercolor artist that described her artwork as whimsical,<br>I started talking about using office projectors, sometimes even connected to programs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq0mA1ZSvmE">GIMP</a> where one can study photographs by reducing number of colors for example.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">At first she didn't care to listen what I was saying, but then, all of a sudden, she got it, her eyes lit up in a way that spoke "I need a projector",<br>and then she flew out the door, never to return, ever again.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Another time, I remember stopping by Ann Arbor's Ambrosia to have a little relaxing drawing session,<br>and the subject of my internet raccoon drawings came up.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">People gathered around and I proudly paraded my Trash Panda Kitties,<br>I was like "Oh, I just started on this one", "And did you see the one where I gave them monocles?" - that one is still my favorite, becoming an artist is really fun.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Adventures help us become artists because they give us the opportunity to take photos in just the perfect way,<br>then all you need to do is discover your favorite method of transferring the outline of your subject to canvas or on paper, and you are ready to go.</div>
