  <p>Wisdom has many names and can be viewed in many different ways,</p>
  <p>most popular perspective is that [non-academic] Philosophy leads to wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One particularly beautiful view,</p>
  <p>hints on wisdom with the words Content of Character.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The most mechanically sound description is,</p>
  <p>understanding new things by subtle analogy to what we already know.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The most concerning view states that,</p>
  <p>without wisdom we will be making mistakes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I think most reasonable view; is all of the above,</p>
  <p>plus knowledge gained from Adventure, Philosophy, and Science Books and Audio Books.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>What is it for?</p>
  <p>Why, it is our Operating System.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>PART II, Thought Experiment</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Allow me to share with you a thought experiment,</p>
  <p>a way of seeing things that aid in your view of the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without wisdom, we form tribes and elect leaders, shamans, or popes,</p>
  <p>and hire muscle, creatures of violence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because that is the same thing the other tribe is doing,</p>
  <p>and the weaker one will be destroyed with great horror.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>These tribal bare bone behavior did not end in middle ages,</p>
  <p>as one would hope.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This behavior is the default human behavior for the frightened and uneducated,</p>
  <p>the desperate, the angry, even the sick.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We may not understand why criminals do the things they do,</p>
  <p>but we can imagine one of our family members, who one by one loses everything.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And on the last day, when all he has left,</p>
  <p>is an ounce of sanity, and a beating hart, he will fight, steal, and hate just to live another day.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And for those who can&apos;t imagine why one would like to live another day when it is all pain,</p>
  <p>to persevere memories, to keep the fallen alive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And here we meet a Man of Honor,</p>
  <p>a Judge, along with a jury, and wealthy lawyers in fantastic shoes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And all they see is a mad man,</p>
  <p>a criminal, a man who needs to be put in a cage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Judge is wrong,</p>
  <p>when it comes to putting people in cages, all judges are wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To restore this man, he needs a home, and books, and friends,</p>
  <p>and an education, and hope, and reams, and free money, and free food.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>He needs to be treated with love and dignity,</p>
  <p>and granted an opportunity to persevere his memories in a book.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There are no criminals,</p>
  <p>they are just broken children.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The ugliness of the worst of them is just an act,</p>
  <p>they just want to be left alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And I suppose that evil men do exist,</p>
  <p>but I don&apos;t think there is enough of them in the world to fill a single prison.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The 10,000,000 people we keep in cages,</p>
  <p>are just children with severe developmental issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There are no political systems advanced enough to treat these beings,</p>
  <p>their only hope is the Public Defender.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Public Defenders will fight to keep the broken people out of prison,</p>
  <p>because they know prison will only make them worse.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If you ever wanted to see a real Angel,</p>
  <p>ask a Judge to let you sit in on a court case, look that tired being in the eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are Human Beings,</p>
  <p>we are not animals to be kept in cages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I have met snarling beasts,</p>
  <p>and I saw their red faces and bulging eyes, and they were just broken kids.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>At first I wanted my older self to come and help me,</p>
  <p>but later I just started calling them My Bullies, they never had a chance at a good life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And here we find a sliver of sanity,</p>
  <p>because there is something that can be done to control crime.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is preventing children from being forced into that desperate mode of existence,</p>
  <p>PREVENTION.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Prevention is a simple thing, Free Home, Free Food, Free Money,</p>
  <p>and Free Tutors, a Real Education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It will take a psychologist to identify those who need help,</p>
  <p>it is as simple as that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>No suffering,</p>
  <p>no harm.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And for those of you who are crazy enough to ask who will pay for this,</p>
  <p>let us call the institution a Bank of Love, right at the Heart of a Country.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They print only as much money as people need to be taken care of,</p>
  <p>and they pride themselves in the amount of debt that nobody will come to collect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Prevention, is really about education,</p>
  <p>because an educated person can make a lot more than any government can grant them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Social Programs, Real Welfare, or Universal Basic Income,</p>
  <p>will grant a person a Home, a Car, Food, and all the necessities, but they can&apos;t pay for extras.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They&apos;ll pay for an education leading up to a Captains License,</p>
  <p>but not the boat.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Prevention will go a long way to bring the number of prisoners down,</p>
  <p>these desperate beings are part of our family, it is all of us or none.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are a young civilization,</p>
  <p>we don&apos;t have governments that can handle Universal Basic Income.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We have governments,</p>
  <p>that can barely handle themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We can cross this bridge, the bridge where we eliminate poverty, and homelessness, and immense fear and suffering,</p>
  <p>suffering that draws those who have the courage to keep fighting into addiction so that they don&apos;t burst out of pain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To get there, to begin growing up as a civilization,</p>
  <p>those of us who can handle it must take to Books and Audio Books and reach Wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Only in your Wisdom can the world begin growing,</p>
  <p>beyond the noisy mess that desperate, blind and tone deaf career politicians created.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The youngest of you are going to inherit all these problems,</p>
  <p>but you will also know that all of these problems are happening due to lack of wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Treat the cause,</p>
  <p>and the symptoms will subside.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Only in wisdom,</p>
  <p>can our civilization advance forward.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Personal Note,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Those of you who are just learning about the world,</p>
  <p>know that it is confusing because hardly anything works right.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Be it a be it a Judge, or General, and most shockingly a Jury,</p>
  <p>they are missing lessons that help them see the world as a Work in Progress.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are still building the foundation,</p>
  <p>and we are getting too much interference from our leadership.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Look no further than the complete loss of privacy,</p>
  <p>this is a function of uneducation and desperation, and blindness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Enhanced interrogation, is even a more terrifying example,</p>
  <p>the world has no faith in nations that practice torture.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The 13th Amendment to Constitution of United States did not end Slavery in Full</p>
  <p>it reads &quot;Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States&quot;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You have a lot of work on your hands,</p>
  <p>and you will have a lot of friends working just as hard as you, and all over the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>While you are still young, take to Adventure Audio Books,</p>
  <p>read them all, and especially pay attention to the part where the adventurer reveals the reason for this quest.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In less than a Hundred Audio Books that call to you,</p>
  <p>you will begin becoming wise onward to becoming a great being.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is in it self a great adventure,</p>
  <p>and if I may, a Memoir is best written as your life unfolds, it is never too early to start writing.</p>
