    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We have to make our way towards books that inspire us,<br>even if all we can do is to spend a life time to build the first book lending network in our part of Congo, or Amazon, or Outback, or Siberia.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In context of archaeology, I was ravenous, and rabid,<br>I had no reservations when it came to fake education, so as long as I was learning for real.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Memorizing dates, overwork, unpaid-internships<br>and digs in dangerous places on the brink of military coups, was my middle name.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If I was allowed to roam free, they would have pulled me into Oxford,<br>to give me an education so that I could learn to follow at least some of the rules.</div>
