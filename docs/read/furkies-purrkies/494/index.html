    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">No matter how distant the expedition, I always brought a second tent with me, I had a battery powered fan in there,<br>a mirror, toiletries, and all the things that a <strong>Sophisticated and Cultured</strong> Mountain Man requires.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I know that this may invite ridicule from all the Unsophisticated and Uncultured,<br>but I at least independently invented the second tent, and I am proud of my invention.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Unless you are in Bear Country, where they have Wolves, Grizzlies, and Venomous Snakes...<br>the most dangerous thing there is, that can get you, is your knife, or axe.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Always wear cut proof gloves and prefer a foldable saw over an axe,<br>cut away from yourself and your hands, and have a first aid kit ready.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Personally, I went to a hardware store, went to the wood working section,<br>and bought the meanest, sharpest and most expensive handsaw I could find.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was always the first to gather my firewood,<br>I just mounted the saw on the outside of my backpack so it never caused any trouble.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you are going to sleep in Canadian Wilderness, you <strong>will</strong> need a rifle, maybe a sidearm,<br>I don't know if bear spray is a good idea, frankly it sounds like a spice, well, unless you get it in addition to your firearms.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And if you are going alone consider learning to ride a Horse so that she can keep watch duty while you sleep,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSh2dSvEeZk&t=549s">or just get a hard shell camper to be perfectly safe</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Wilderness like Nordhouse, or any wilderness without danger signs,<br>may have some Black Bears, but these are Raccoon minded.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They <strong>may</strong> charge you, but if you make yourself bigger and meaner by extending your arms and yelling loudly,<br>or just going for their jugular with your teeth, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vIwNyqIceE">the black bears will run away</a>.</div>

  <div class="section card-body mb-0 my-2">
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Always have a safe fire going before it gets dark,<br>you start a fire by lighting match sized sticks, and then just go up in size, adding bigger an bigger sticks.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I used to bring a fire starer with me,<br>which is basically wood fiber and candle wax.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They light easy, and keep going until large sticks are aflame,<br>oh, an you can never have too much firewood, so prepare a bigger pile than you think you may need.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Sleeping bags have ratings, some are rated for summer weather, others for 32 degrees, and even minus fifteen,<br>but don't trust those numbers completely.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you are going to sleep in 50 degree Fahrenheit weather get a sleeping bag rated for 32 degrees,<br>you can always open it a little bit if it gets too warm.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I had a cheap sleeping pad that went under the sleeping bag to isolate me from the cold ground,<br>but it blew away in the wind once, and I never missed it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I slept on the ground in my sleeping bag, just fine,<br>but I recommend you get an expensive inflatable one, as they don't weigh much.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One time,<br>I had visitors.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A mom and her teenage daughter moved in, near by,<br>which was unusual for Nordhouse, as people are supposed to camp far apart.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">her daughter had an axe and immediately started chopping down a small and healthy tree,<br>when I told her that this is a protected area and the tree is no good for firewood...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">She made an expression that clearly and without a doubt stated,<br>that from this point on, she will hate me, for as long as I freaking live.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But get this, the mother neither had a tent, not a sleeping bag,<br>she slept on the soft grass, and probably enjoyed incredible views.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So, yes there are spiders, but there is an order of things in the woods,<br>neither spiders nor black bears will attack, our ancestors slept on the ground or on a pile of pine tree branches for hundreds of thousands of years, and they were just fine.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But I must say that, in 2019 on one of my bicycle adventures, I've noticed Tick Warning signs,<br>and ticks continued popping up in the news in 2020 and 2021, at the time of this writing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Use a tent, and do a tick check before sleep, and stay out of tall grasses, stick to the trails,<br>some people that do venture in deep woods like to duck tape their pants to their shoes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Use a bug repellent,<br>and be very careful with tick killer spray around animals.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Sticking to the trails and sleeping in a tent,<br>will prevent all tick problems.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As to mosquitoes, use a repellent in the shape of a smoldering stick,<br>and then spray yourself as well, watch out for the hot ash when moving the stick, and don't put it too close to your tent.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One time, I was playing chicken with a distant Thunder Storm,<br>I watched it out on the horizon for a long time, it was very far away but I could the the flashes of Lightening.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was staying atop a dune,<br>in an elevated location.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As my eyes got used to darkness,<br>the Dune Grass begun glowing with blue static electricity.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I lost that chicken game real fast,<br>and move my camp to a temporary but safer location in the woods.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It didn't rain,<br>the storm remained on the horizon until it turned to rain on the other side of Lake Michigan.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">On another occasion, I've noticed some party goes out on the less wild side of the woods,<br>it looked like they were drinking and getting ready for a party.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I gathered my firewood, had a fire and a fine sausage, no spices, no ketchup, just the meat,<br>it was from a gas station but it tasted like the finest snacks.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWmsxtu248U">I set aside my Art Sketches for the night</a>, put on an Audiobook,<br>and quickly fell asleep.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And woke up just as quickly, and it was 11PM, or maybe 1AM,<br>and it sounded scary, it was a scream, it was getting closer.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">My first thought was, Witches and Witchcraft, I sighed as I pulled out my Hunting knife,<br>and readied for battle.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When I awoke a little bit more,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBpZTo1dlPM">I remembered that foxes have that piercing scream</a>, and it sounded exactly like a fox, but longer.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">By this time it was even closer,<br>so I decided to press my headphones deeper-in, and go to sleep.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Later, I heard multiple voices, and realized one of the tipsy people went to their car,<br>and then confused the terrain, they actually needed to walk another five minutes to get to their camp, where they were at was just an area damaged by a tornado.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I did want to go and help, but they should not have gone alone, and they obviously had alcohol in their system, plus they weren't in any danger out there,<br>the last thing this person needed was to see a neatly smelling Mountain Man crawl out of the woods and start babbling something about screaming foxes.</div>
