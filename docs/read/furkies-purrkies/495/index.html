    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">All the tools and maintenance items that have ever touched your bicycle,<br>have to ride a long with you, and you have to check them for damage.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I ran over a pointy stick in my second Fat Tire bike,<br>and my back tire exploded, the stick actually flew up in the air.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The hole is still there, and the inner tube is unprotected in that spot,<br>it is slightly larger than a pencil.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This happened about eight miles from my apartment,<br>and while I had all the tools, the glue on the stickers for my inner tube dried out, as did the little used tube of tire cement.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">My tire repair kit was too old,<br>I walked a mile or two to a gas station, and had my parents pick me up.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The next day I used another bicycle, to get to my fat tire bike, repair its tire so that it would spin,<br>and then I slowly rode back on one bicycle, while holding the other.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I actually had to go to the supermarket and get a little plastic kiddie pool,<br>then I filled it with water and soap, and only then found the microscopic puncture.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The wisdom for this problem is, find the piece of metal that punctured your tire,<br>and then carefully examine the inner tube in the same spot.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You will need to do some detective work,<br>it does not have to be a very big hole to deflate a tire overnight.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was lucky today, I found a very old roofing nail,<br>this thing could be from 1920's, you can see the structure of the metal, it looks like the top half of a nail.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But even so, because I didn't notice the flat tire for a few of days,<br>the rubber structure got out of shape, and that is really bad news.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because, all tires, are ever so slightly larger than the metal rim they sit on,<br>this is on purpose, this gives you the much needed wiggle room to take the tire off of the rim.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And you have to use a little plastic wedge, I had one of them snap on me today,<br>without that extra wiggle room, it may not be possible to take the tire off the rim.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The part of the tire that touches the metal rim has metal wires in it,<br>there is no stretching there, you only get the wiggle room.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I used my remaining two wedges to negotiate the tire off the rim, but only in the spot where the nail was,<br>that allowed me to grab the inner tube, and pull it out, and then I used some "bubbles" to verify that a tiny little black dot I spotted there, was the problem spot.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One time I noticed an abandoned bicycle, and then few minutes later a gentleman hurrying to Ford. Rd.,<br>I flat out asked him if he need a tire repair kit and held out one of my unused, unopened boxes, it was the good stuff too.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">He was like "Dude?", he had his phone with him, and my guess was that he called one of his friends to pick him up,<br>they were going to go to the store get a kit and he would go back to fix his bicycle.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I turned an hour long problem,<br>into five minutes of nuisance, he already knew how to fix tires, he even had a no-nonsense air pump with him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Just the moment he took the kit, I took off,<br>but I learned from him to get a no-nonsense air pump.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Using the little ones is crazy to me,<br>I got one for $11 buck or so, and it didn't seem to work at all, I am pretty sure the one I have is good motorcycles.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I actually ended up buying Velcro straps to attach it to my handlebar,<br>it takes like 30 pumps to fill a tire, it is awesome.</div>

<div class="card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow">
  <div class="section card-body mb-0 my-2">
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I scratched up the surface where the little hole was with sand paper,<br>I put a layer of glue on it, then I used a fresh square of rubber that also had some glue on it, and when that dried, I added extra glue around the edges.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Always do a glue sandwich,<br>put the glue everywhere, the glue that is on the patch is not very good, you need glue that is hermetically closed in an aluminum tube.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is the difference between walking and riding,<br>serious business.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When I ride my bicycle early spring,<br>there are metal wires, and nails everywhere, from construction, maybe snow plows pushing highway garbage onto the trail...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">and certainly from that steel wired inner part of truck tires,<br>once a tire falls to pieces, and patches of that rubber and steel start decaying after some years, it becomes like little needles.</div>

  <div class="section card-body mb-0 my-2">
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Once I put in the inner tube, and inflated it, in those 30 pumps or so,<br>my bicycle tire came apart.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Probably mostly because the tire was deformed,<br>from sitting flat for a few days until I noticed it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This deformation, will combine with that little wiggle room you have,<br>to make it so that your tire just comes apart.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That wiggle room, when the tire is perfectly centered around the rim,<br>disappears completely.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You have to inflate your tire just enough,<br>to start walking your bicycle in circles, and let things balance out.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Let that deformation lose the hold over your tire,<br>let the tire distribute it self around the rim.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Just do a few circles walking the bike,<br>and then resume inflating it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For myself, just to be sure,<br>I stopped a second time, and got on the bicycle and rolled forward an back, to get that wiggle room to distribute it self perfectly around the metal rim.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It took a couple of tries, so be patient, rinse and repeat,<br>that wiggle room is not your enemy, it is there so that you can take the tire off the rim, and fix your flat.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But as you are inflating the tire, roll the dough,<br>massage the tire into the center, so that the wiggle room is not in any spot, or your inner tube will push the tire apart in that spot.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Do not inflate with wiggle room present,<br>or things will get frustrating.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One time, when I still had my Mountain Bike,<br>I've noticed a boy pushing his bicycle really hard with the chain being stuck between gears and those spokes that hold the rim up.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">He said he wanted a movie, so he grabbed a bicycle, and this thing just fell apart, can I fix it,<br>I think I got it going, he was really shaken up, he was not having a good time.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I don't think I just left him there pushing the damn thing forward,<br>I probably pulled out the chain, and put it back on the gear, but also would have warned him that this won't hold up.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">He said he went to a nearby repair shop and they wanted money,<br>for him using their tools.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was coming back from one of my longest adventures, I was tired,<br>but I am certain I put the chain back on, though at the time, I didn't know enough about bicycles to push his rear tire back and tighten the chain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I do remember however that, that after I did whatever I could, I went to the repair store,<br>and said that the boy is really shaken up, and that we need to help each other, and my voice broke, I closed the door an went on my way.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I told several people about that heartlessness and laziness,<br>and told them to avoid that store, they are overprices and reek of predatory behavior.</div>

  <div class="section card-body mb-0 my-2">
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The big wisdom here, is to stop inflating the tire about 30% in,<br>and roll the dough, get that tire in the center of the rim.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And before you take off with your patched tire,<br>triple check that you got all the tools back into your bicycle bags.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">My left pedal started feeling loose, the thing was going to fall off in 10 minutes flat,<br>and if I was unlucky I would lose the assembly that held it in place.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It was getting dark, and the moment I stopped mosquitoes were all over my face,<br>there were so many of them, that I just ended up spraying them with bug repellent - and I did not get bit.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I needed the correct tools, and one of those fun wrenches that makes a fancy sound,<br>and since the screw holding a pedal is inset in the pedal, I needed a socket thing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because I keep all the tools on the bicycle,<br>I had everything with me, and the repair took two minuets.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The socket thing was slightly too big, metric probably,<br>but with mosquitoes flying around my face I didn't have time to look for the correct thing.</div>
