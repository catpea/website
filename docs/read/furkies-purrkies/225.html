  <p>For Humans, tragically,</p>
  <p>it is either knowledge or conflict.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We come from warring tribes,</p>
  <p>humanity has risen from war.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>That rise came from,</p>
  <p>increasing levels of knowledge.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The modern Human has been around for 200,000 years,</p>
  <p>it is the knowledge that we inherit, and pass on, that helps us grow up.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>If education is broken,</p>
  <p>that that precious knowledge that sets us apart from warring tribes,</p>
  <p>will become lost.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The knowledge is hard won, by many great beings,</p>
  <p>Women and Men who sacrificed for Future Generations.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We are those generations,</p>
  <p>and we must Honor the Philosophers, all the Humanity&apos;s Greatest Thinkers,</p>
  <p>by inheriting from them and becoming Great Beings Too.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>To fail, is to dishonor,</p>
  <p>Humanity&apos;s most beautiful Hopes and Dreams.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Is to break countless hearts,</p>
  <p>that date back thousands of years.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We are not that kind of creature.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We are Noble, and Loving, Exceptional,</p>
  <p>and Infinitely Intelligent.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We must pay attention,</p>
  <p>to the transfer of Knowledge and Wisdom between generations,</p>
  <p>we must help the children to the books</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The schools are failing,</p>
  <p>whatever it is that they are doing,</p>
  <p>disconnected facts, and blurry memories are nothing,</p>
  <p>and they fail, they fail, and may actually cause harm.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Schools are making people think they are not intelligent enough,</p>
  <p>but nothing could be further from the truth</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Intelligent is exactly what we are,</p>
  <p>we each have great Mental Powers.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Knowledge comes from books,</p>
  <p>from lives of other people.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Off the top of our heads,</p>
  <p>we will only remember 10 books,</p>
  <p>when pressed more than a thousand.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>If those books are not read,</p>
  <p>if we go through schools, pretending to inherit knowledge.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The global level of knowledge will drop,</p>
  <p>the Human Family will begin breaking up smaller,</p>
  <p>equally misinformed groups</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We will see a rise in nationalism, terrorism,</p>
  <p>constant tensions, threats, and protests.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>All these anomalies will be pointing away,</p>
  <p>from World Peace, Our Dignity and Wisdom.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Imagine two soldiers, both are kids,</p>
  <p>both were taught to kill each other by their teachers.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>All Humans are equally intelligent,</p>
  <p>all are capable of Indescribable Love and Infinite Creativity and Genius.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Their deadly difference,</p>
  <p>is in their Knowledge.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And not just what they have been made to believe,</p>
  <p>but also, and perhaps more importantly, the level of their knowledge.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The more we know, the more we grow,</p>
  <p>the closer we come together.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>If their nations granted them real knowledge,</p>
  <p>there would be no conflict, no dying, no killing.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And not just Books, but the Recitations of their best Parts,</p>
  <p>works of Vonnegut, Whitman, Neruda, Defoe, Melville, Bukowski,</p>
  <p>Wittgenstein, Nietzsche, Kant, Rand; Bryson, Tyson, and Hitch.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>There would be no war,</p>
  <p>we&apos;ve already had enough of war.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Education stopped filling us with Knowledge,</p>
  <p>schools are pretending to teach now.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Perhaps it has always been the case,</p>
  <p>but today, they aren&apos;t even trying.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>What student&apos;s learn they learn on their own,</p>
  <p>schools just provide the tests and entertainment.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We are more than this,</p>
  <p>even though the Doctor may get their M.D.,</p>
  <p>there may not be a world to practice in.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The threat of nuclear war has grown,</p>
  <p>in the past 50 years the world lost two-thirds of its wildlife.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Just because some percentage of students are learning,</p>
  <p>it does not mean that schools are working.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It takes more than a Doctor of a Lawyer,</p>
  <p>it takes precisely 7,800,000,000 of well educated and reasonably informed people.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>All it takes to get there is free access to audio versions of leading books,</p>
  <p>where students can learn in privacy, in peace, and without the threat of shame.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>School is fake,</p>
  <p>it is not working.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Fake Education is tearing us apart,</p>
  <p>pushing the world further into an unsustainable fantasy.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Let us help each other,</p>
  <p>please, search the Public Domain for books that move you,</p>
  <p>teach your self to narrate them, and share this beautiful art,</p>
  <p>out of love, and for peace, and freedom, and for all the future generations to come.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Let us bring levels of knowledge up to where they should be,</p>
  <p>we are better than this, we are smarter than this, we are greater than this.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>School and education are cold and heartless words.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It is, love of life, and love of wisdom, and love of knowing,</p>
  <p>and love of finding things out, and love of The Universe we live in.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Let us stop pretending that education is enough,</p>
  <p>Knowledge, we must learn to stand in relentless pursuit of Knowledge,</p>
  <p>our Greatest Adventure, at our own pace, and in our own sequence.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Education can make a Doctor,</p>
  <p>but it is Knowledge and Wisdom that makes a Great Being.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Let us help the little ones to Knowledge and Wisdom,</p>
  <p>so that their children are born to a Kinder, and More Compassionate, and Peaceful World.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>A world most worthy of them.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Let us begin by reading, narrating or listening to World&apos;s most beloved non-fiction and adventure books.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>For in the absence of real education,</p>
  <p>we become the teachers.</p>
