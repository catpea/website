  <p>Real education is a Great Empowering Adventure,</p>
  <p>that begins, with what is interesting to us.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It&apos;s how Human Beings progress forward,</p>
  <p>it&apos;s how Socrates, DaVinci, Bruno, Newton, became known.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They followed a path as dictated by their mind,</p>
  <p>and that dictation occurs, once precise layer after another.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You can become a genius within 10 years,</p>
  <p>but this is not a race, it is best to take 30 years.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Thirty is perfect.</p>
  <div class="section">
    <hr>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>Don&apos;t worry, the schools are broken,</p>
    <p>they are exactly as worthless as you think they are.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>Grades are an insult to your mind,</p>
    <p>and teachers will spew all kinds of nonsense but they just want to get paid.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>Be warned, my Friend,</p>
    <p>the classroom is the worst thing that can happen to a curious mind,</p>
    <p>it will slice everything into boring irrelevant disconnected facts,</p>
    <p>and force you into performing memory tricks with things that you will never want to remember.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>Resist, but don&apos;t drop out,</p>
    <p>just go to the library.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>Eventually, you&apos;ll end at at the deans office,</p>
    <p>just tell them the truth, you fell in love with Learning.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>The Dean will tag you as a genius,</p>
    <p>but you can&apos;t allow this to happen.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>You are not gifted, you are not a genius - we are all geniuses.</p>
    <div class="section">
      <p>All the other kids you left behind,</p>
      <p>they need you to tell them that school is not teaching.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>It is only making you role-play with memorization tricks,</p>
      <p>it is actually preventing everyone from learning.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>This is not intentional,</p>
      <p>there is no government conspiracy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Only mediocrity, people who are just trying to fake it until they make it.</p>
      <div class="section">
        <p>I am sorry.</p>
        <div class="section">
          <p>But if you just keep to the library,</p>
          <p>keep making your way through all the lovable books.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>And above all, watch over the others,</p>
          <p>keep an eye on the ones who are cracking.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>They need your help,</p>
          <p>they need a way out.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They don&apos;t need hand holding,</p>
          <p>they just need a way out.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>That way is: Start-ups, building a little business,</p>
          <p>building on their own ideas, in their own universe,</p>
          <p>tell them to look up Y-Combinator and find something like it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>This way, if they fail, they will have an opportunity to come back up,</p>
          <p>by saying &quot;The world has failed me, but I will not fail myself, I will not let them crush me.&quot;</p>

          <p>Help the others to books, the weird kids, well the really weird kids that actually like math,</p>
          <p>they will love Brian Greene, they may not necessarily read the whole book,</p>
          <p>or even enjoy Quantum Physics, they just need to know that they can understand it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Most of the kids will needed Audio Books,</p>
          <p>we can&apos;t really read as well as the Author,</p>
          <p>an in any way there is five ways to voice a paragraph, leave it to the author.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>And then Documentaries, Climate, Education, Philosophy,</p>

          <p>which is marked by natural curiosity, comfort, and a sense of progression.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Moreover, once they take that first step and taste their first lesson,</p>
          <p>the second lesson will come much easier, because in their mind,</p>
          <p>it is connected, it is connected by the path they are on.</p>

          <p>In school when when we switch from Language to Math, Music, and Biology,</p>
          <p>there is no path, there is no continuity, there can only be temporary memorization,</p>
          <p>and permanent forgetting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>There is no building one layer after another towards Wisdom and Enlightenment,</p>
          <p>there is just graduation and desperation that leads to a shitty job.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Such a blind, dead end, death march toward the end of youth, cheerfulness, and dreams,</p>
          <p>will induce depression, self medication, acting out, fighting, and sometimes addiction or worse.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Add grades, that many stupid teachers passionately care about,</p>
          <p>to the point of not just thinking that students are stupid,</p>
          <p>but actually convincing many of the students,</p>
          <p>that the pointless grade is a measure of of their intelligence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Sit them in rows to listen to incomprehensible curricula,</p>
          <p>that can only be blindly memorized, by a half crazed madman.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Sprinkle in a bunch of bullies,</p>
          <p>with a mix of not-my-problem teachers that can only proclaim &quot;Life isn&apos;t fair for us all.&quot;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>And, then when they come home, add parents that punish them for no longer having any respect left for them.</p>
