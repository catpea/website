    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I think this is something that people refer to as positive thinking,<br>as being positive, as living on the sunny side.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But my discovery was independent of that,<br>I was deep in the woods, with rays of sunshine everywhere.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And chipmunks were all over the place,<br>they were running around like crazy.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">With me, in my thoughts was Dear Viktor Frankl, and Friedrich, and Socrates,<br>and a half remembered memory of someone saying: "Life Is What You Make Of It".</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Socrates was asking Crito to be of Good Cheer,<br>and I was asking about meaning, and the chipmunks were asking why I was ruining their morning ways.</div>

  <div class="section card-body mb-0 my-2">
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And it occurred to me, that when the Ancient Greeks spoke of the Four Virtues:<br>Wisdom, Courage, Moderation, and Justice...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then Europe in the Middle Ages spoke of:<br>Chastity, Temperance, Charity, Diligence, Patience, Kindness, and Humility.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And the Knightly Virtues called for:<br>Courage, Justice, Mercy, Generosity, Faith, Nobility, and Hope.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And Bushido beautifully framed,<br>Sincerity, Responsibility, Frugality, Politeness, Modesty, Loyalty, Harmony, Tranquility, and Compassion.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">and Aquinas underlined that it not only matters what a person does,<br>but how the person does it.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They didn't really mention Cheerfulness,<br>Cheerfulness is extremely powerful.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Friedrich for example said,<br>"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how."</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And Victor added, that when all is taken away, the last of the human freedoms is:<br>"to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But, I think that in modern days, we need more,<br>because finding meaning, is not just about finding meaning in suffering.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Meaning is about all the things that present a challenge,<br>and we need to formulate a good answer for all things, not just misery.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We need an answer that also works when nothing too terrible is going on,<br>like: "What the hell is the meaning of an Alarm Clock?", or "Why is the whole world poor, when there is always money for war."</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And of course that big old question, of the meaning of life,<br>which is not a miserable question, at all.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And here I remembered Richard Dawkins talking about some questions being silly,<br>just because something is grammatically correct it does not make it a serious question.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I think he was in general talking about the question of "Why are we here?",<br>being grammatically correct, but not really a serious question.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The meaning of life is found in becoming a Great Being,<br>exactly like Richard Dawkins, Friedrich NIetzsche, Viktor Frankl and Socrates, and all the other Knowledgable, Wise, Inspirational, Great Beings.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That of course deals with the science side of things, but also the cheerfulness of Murray Gell-Mann himself,<br>his laughter towards the end of the talk, and the love and understanding of his audience, perfectly, PERFECTLY, captures that other half.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We are here to be Human, to Share Wisdom, to Teach, to Admire, and Inspire, and Chuckle, and Laugh,<br>that Laughter in the end of his TED talk is a special kind of laughter.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">My original discovery of this beautiful kind of laughter came from just about the time when I was packing for one of my great walks,<br>again sunny days, filled with cute little adventures, always packing to go somewhere, and wearing multiple fanny packs.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuMB5e91BGo">Richard Dawkins giving one of his talks</a>,<br>and the way the audience Loved Him, and adorned him with that laughter of understanding, made me speechless, made me appreciate and admire the students in the audience.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://youtu.be/uuMB5e91BGo?t=4642">Their laughter was a sign of heights of intelligence that I have never seen before</a>,<br>I sat down to pay more attention to the video and wait for the audience to display the appreciation of what Richard stands for, with that purity of laughter.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I can whole-hardheartedly say, we are here in great part to share in that kind of laughter of Wisdom, and Understanding, and Love of Science,<br>and admiration for the clear thinking of Great Beings like Richard Dawkins and his honest and beautiful answers.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Now why is there money for war, but they is the world poor?<br>because politics are primitive, they don't yet do the Humans Justice.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Politics have ways to go before they develop,<br>to become good enough for us.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Laws that structure a nation,<br>are like a computer program.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If that program is badly written,<br>and if it is lacking good programmers to fix that program.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Then there will be so many problems,<br>the whole system will be slow, and full of bugs, and corrupt things, and will require constant manual review, and repair, and it will never be enough.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A well designed political system, eliminates poverty, replaces prisons with schools and mental institutions,<br>makes sure that everyone gets a real education that they become proud of.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This requires great thinkers, generations of Great Beings,<br>redesigning politics all around the world.</div>

  <div class="section card-body mb-0 my-2">
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Which brings us to the final question,<br>the question of the alarm clock.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The alarm clock, is a kind of a test, and reminder,<br>it exists for the purpose of one day being smashed to smithereens, by you.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is a constant reminder, that you are supposed to smash it, or just turn it off if it is on your phone, or a family heirloom,<br>and instead of preparing for work that day, prepare for an adventure.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Go shopping, for really, really expensive, and colorful adventure shoes,<br>that have plenty of room for thick socks, nice and soft, and warm... thick socks.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And get a backpack, probably the bigger the better,<br>but it also has to be really sturdy.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And you will need a tent!<br>even if you are not planning the walk to last more than a day, it is still fun to have a tent.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Sometimes it is great to just set it up in your back yard,<br>or set it up in the middle of a woodland walk to lay down a little, and have a sandwich, or a nap, or just look out from if there is a nice view.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The first time you go on a walk,<br>bring a notepad, not just for philosophical thoughts, but to just make a list of all the stuff you wish you had with you.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">While I never quite used it, I always carried a cowboy hat and a bug net,<br>that you pout over the hat just in case a fly start bothering you, presumably - stuff like that.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In short, the meaning of an alarm clock,<br>is to alarm you, when you are ready to smash it to smithereens and become a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFr4bTfm40c">Professional Adventurer</a> that goes on Great Many, Great and Cheerful Philosophical Adventures.</div>
