  <p>Of course, it is not just aging,</p>
  <p>but is it also more than just learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Some say &quot;Lean into the discomfort.&quot;,</p>
  <p>others &quot;Don&apos;t try go all the way.&quot;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is all about building ourselves,</p>
  <p>layer by layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The layers,</p>
  <p>need not always be on the same subject.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You may start an artist, or a dreamer, or a mechanic,</p>
  <p>and then move to urban explorer, photographer, and islander.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The steps we take are slightly different,</p>
  <p>from what we take away.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>An artist learns the harmony of colors,</p>
  <p>the strange simplicity of desaturating colors by mixing opposites.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The dreamer learns that a dream is not just a dream,</p>
  <p>because if you snag on it and carry it out, it will become true.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The mechanic learns about a screw,</p>
  <p>if you tighten it too much you will ruin it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The urban explorer learns that the attorney,</p>
  <p>that left his stuff behind was always suffering and died alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The photographer learns that it is the journey,</p>
  <p>and the photo is a mere bookmark in memories.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And the islander,</p>
  <p>ohh, the islander.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Finally, when the golden age of wisdom and endless aches and grunts comes,</p>
  <p>the islander learns that life is to be lived fully.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And what that means, is that we take what we learned from the day before,</p>
  <p>mix it with today, and get it ready to mix it with tomorrow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Like a waterfall that runs into to the ocean,</p>
  <p>the new things we learn add to the body of the old.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>With old age being a privilege denied to so many,</p>
  <p>the treasure we carry truly becomes magnificent as we move forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We can&apos;t learn all at once,</p>
  <p>and we can&apos;t fully learn through synthetic means.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>At schools the curriculum is so warped,</p>
  <p>it can only be dishonestly memorized.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Audio Books and Lectures, go a long way,</p>
  <p>so as long as you make room for the lessons within.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Education requires room, here there can be no stress from grades,</p>
  <p>no craziness for a high GPA, brand name education, and a promise of a job.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We need life, we need the full thickness of life,</p>
  <p>and then an urge to study will emerge.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That thick life,</p>
  <p>will move us.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It will uncover an absence of knowledge,</p>
  <p>and it will feel great to fill it right up with precisely 14 books on the subject.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A synthetic education born from being forced to learn,</p>
  <p>is a very poor education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Memorization,</p>
  <p>is not an education at all, it is actually dangerous and stupid.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And networking with grads from a brand name university to get stuff done,</p>
  <p>has nothing to do with getting educated, it is a service trading club.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Learning from books,</p>
  <p>whilst walking a huge trail filled with Bobcats and Mountain Lions,</p>
  <p>is far superior of a teacher than anything claiming to educate today.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And one of the best things about books,</p>
  <p>is that they make mistakes sometimes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Their authors get so inspired,</p>
  <p>that their ideas sometimes take off and fly in the sky.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And when you catch a famous Author on such a flight of fancy,</p>
  <p>you learn even more, you learn about Excellence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>(And how useless, and desperate, and child like book critics are.)</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Medical Schools are not an exception here,</p>
  <p>textbooks are important, practice even more,</p>
  <p>but so is healing a person on the inside, within their mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We can all imagine an excellent doctor, extremely professional,</p>
  <p>perfect grades, well read, awesome person all around, no complaints.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And we can imagine what it is like to suffer without hope,</p>
  <p>and seeing this kind individual, just move on to the next patient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>See, being a perfect Doctor, is not enough,</p>
  <p>the surgery is not over when the procedure is done.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And people can tell when someone merely follows etiquette,</p>
  <p>and merely pops in for a moment to say something nice, and be done with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Be it a Doctor, Scientist, Musician, Artist,</p>
  <p>Dreamer, Adventurer, Rebel, even Beloved Professor...</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>...more is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Greatness of heart,</p>
  <p>is a really good start.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But, I think the golden standard of Life and Art,</p>
  <p>is; Vastness of Heart.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>There is no describing it, but these Beautiful Beings,</p>
  <p>smile, and laugh, no matter the weather,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And when they speak, they seem to be part of Cosmos,</p>
  <p>not just Earth.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>A Mechanic who borrows from his work,</p>
  <p>for purposes of Wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Will hold up a screw,</p>
  <p>and say.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>&quot;In order for this important piece of the system to do its job,</p>
  <p>you have to know when too much of tightening the screw will damage it.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is a good example of what we see in schools,</p>
  <p>Elementary is a Dream, Middle School kind of works,</p>
  <p>but creating High School by just making subjects more demanding, is insane.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The screw is tightened,</p>
  <p>damaged, and now, it cannot be repaired.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>At the very least, we must help the children to create a start-up,</p>
  <p>to work together on building 3D printed inventions, learning Linux, and coming up with new stuff.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And help them setup a way of charging customers,</p>
  <p>a way of advertising products, and wipe their fears of poverty.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The kids, are always smarter than us,</p>
  <p>they build on top of what we have built.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are not giving them the tools for their future,</p>
  <p>we teach pure Trigonometry and this cannot be dumber.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because to teach Trigonometry,</p>
  <p>all the teacher has to do is create a class about</p>
  <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/2736-trigonometry-for-game-programming-part-1-2">building games</a> that get published on Steam (game store).
  <div class="section">
    <p>What a teacher may not do,</p>
    <p>is force feed pure triangle garbage to people who don&apos;t have an interest in it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>It is not hormones (and no teacher should ever say that), students simply stop listing,</p>
    <p>when they figure out the teachers are... selling them out for a paycheck.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <hr>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>Dreamers are my favorite,</p>
    <p>here is someone who sits down and thinks up the following,</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>&quot;If I was born on a different continent,</p>
    <p>to a different religion, I would be asked to worship that other god that I am told is false.&quot;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>&quot;Furthermore,&quot; - and you know there is always a furthermore,</p>
    <p>that&apos;s part of the reason why they cannot be stopped.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>&quot;Aren&apos;t we all atheists,</p>
    <p>to all the other gods.&quot;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>And just when you think she was done with it,</p>
    <p>she adds &quot;Why don&apos;t we go the extra step and love All Life, All Wisdom, All Good Ideas, and All Human Beings&quot;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>And the next thing you know,</p>
    <p>you realize she was never a Dreamer, nor was she ever little.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>She&apos;s a Philosopher.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <p>To tell children, that there exists a group of Universal Beings,</p>
    <p>that dedicate their lives and immortality to Wisdom,</p>
    <p>and passing it on to all the future generations,</p>
    <p>is to help them grow from the highest of mountains.</p>
