  <p>Mistakes and Misunderstandings divide Humanity today,</p>
  <p>noting can be done because varying levels of education interfere with unity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of the biggest mistakes is ineffective education</p>
  <p>tricking students into believing that they are educated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Mis-education, fake education, ineffective education makes us blind,</p>
  <p>truths and facts are drowned in an ocean of conflicting and equally wrong opinions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Real education, is the key to unity, to a common grasp on reality,</p>
  <p>but all the roads there are obscured by confused and confusing chatter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is not until we accept the responsibility for our own education,</p>
  <p>that we will start learning, for real.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The biggest mistake is borders,</p>
  <p>groups of wealthy uneducated people coming together to decide the futures of their nations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>These men claim greatness,</p>
  <p>and hold up their experience as their proof.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But experience is no substitute for wisdom,</p>
  <p>on the surface experience makes a person indistinguishable from a wise one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The first clue to distinguish the two, is found in length of vision,</p>
  <p>when they get around to speaking of problems of today, they will give excuses that they know - from experience - will hold up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But they will dismiss the future entirely,</p>
  <p>because to speak of the future; a person needs a direction, a vision, an objective, a purpose, a wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Men of experience, are too small minded, too blind and limited, to shallow, to fragile,</p>
  <p>to see into things that have no impact on them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Our levels of education are insufficient to directly address the problems that we face today,</p>
  <p>there are too few well educated, knowledgeable and wise beings to repair anything right now.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>An uneducated voting majority is all to easily swayed and misled,</p>
  <p>and our poverty will prevent our generation from re-learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of the worst things about general poverty,</p>
  <p>is that it induces a poverty of mind, out of lack of time, out of stress, fear, and discomfort.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Reality, has no borders, as climate change and pandemics show us,</p>
  <p>in reality we are one human family.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And in reality, poverty is tearing the world apart,</p>
  <p>it is keeping us weak.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In reality, a teenager in a dictatorship on the other side of the world,</p>
  <p>is your friend, they would love you if you sent them popular snacks from your city, some photos and music.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They are family,</p>
  <p>there are people out there who would be genuinely kinder to you than some of your own family.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is sooooo sad that we label each other with the names of our nations,</p>
  <p>and return to tend to whatever poverty we are facing at the moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Internet, student exchange, programs like Peace Corps,</p>
  <p>and documents like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights help us see in our confused state.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But it is just a tiny sliver of light,</p>
  <p>poverty of mind alone is almost unaffected by it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>United Nations has its hands tied,</p>
  <p>without an appropriate level of education General Assembly will stand in a constant state of disagreement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without a plan to unite, and eliminate poverty,</p>
  <p>we are all equally wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And we can&apos;t have Unity and Prosperity without Knowledge and Wisdom,</p>
  <p>liars would instantly invent something that they stand to lose, and tear the world right up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Do you hear me, do you see what I am saying,</p>
  <p>we are one, it is all of us, or none.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The way to fix it,</p>
  <p>is by inventing educational programs that really help children to knowledge, wisdom and greatness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because until we hold long term visions fueled by Knowledge and Wisdom,</p>
  <p>the only thing we can agree on, is what the liars want us to believe in.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Real education is the thing that leads us to have thoughts independent to what is on TV and in News Papers,</p>
  <p>it helps us see who the liars, and mark my words for this sorry year, even when they assume a pleasing shape.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Real Education grants us Intellectual Independence,</p>
  <p>where audio book by book we all independently gain a valid grasp on reality.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Organized education will always bend under the threat of being defunded or kept in poverty,</p>
  <p>it will help to invent brand name institutions that are only better in the name, but all equally ineffective.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Organized education will rip talent out of children, it will sand it down until they are all equally lost,</p>
  <p>mixed with poverty most parents won&apos;t even be granted the ability to care about what is happening to the minds of their children, because the babysitting is good.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Organized education ends up causing harm to children&apos;s intellectual development,</p>
  <p>it holds them back and causes so much stress that it is impossible to learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Organized education is such a problem, that even the best minds of our generations,</p>
  <p>are still thinking about &quot;Free College&quot; - about paying those fraudulent institutions - instead of funding ones that are capable of Real Education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Things are pretty bad, thankfully, we are infinite in our capacity to deal with real dangers,</p>
  <p>especially the ones that tear tear our family apart.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Real education is based on students&apos; predispositions,</p>
  <p>and curiosities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For example, when someone is interested in the moon or stars at night,</p>
  <p>that marks an entry point into Science Fiction, Astrophysics, Astrography and if they continue to care, Optics, Mathematics, Physics, Writing and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Most children won&apos;t care for stars very long, because they are interested in exploring all of the universe,</p>
  <p>and that is even better because then there is a multitude of passage ways they can use to walk through the sciences.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But it has to be their own walking, their own direction, and at their own pace,</p>
  <p>we have to honor their predispositions and curiosities, the students are the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We have to remove grades, tests, graduation, class rooms, time divisions, subject divisions, rows of seats, groupings of any kind be it age or area of study,</p>
  <p>we have to replace the teacher with personalized learning and tutors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And we have to give the students what they need, a telescope, a fast single board computer with all the sensors and servos they could ever need,</p>
  <p>they need the ability to launch satellites, to operate small remotely operated submarines and small drones, they need access to things they are curious about.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If a student is walking the wrong path, then it is a path that has been been walked many times before, they are asking a question, and they need powerful answers,</p>
  <p>they have to see what war is like, what prisons are like, what concentration camps are like - and what love is like - and they will learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>At the time of writing this in 2020, I realized that there are three nations that operate concentrations camps,</p>
  <p>which is probably to say, that there are many; and they need to see that too.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They need to see gang violence, and if they are still around then meet up with Father Gregory Boyle&apos;s boys,</p>
  <p>for they have surely become Great Beings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Nothing goes wrong in real education,</p>
  <p>real education is about reality, about really growing up, and really being human.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And when these students grow up, become voters, Senators and Congresswomen and Congressmen,</p>
  <p>then the liars, and pretenders, will lose their hold on humanity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then the members of General Assembly of United nations,</p>
  <p>can finally have their day, in agreement and unity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>My friends,</p>
  <p>never lose hope.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If something important can&apos;t happen today,</p>
  <p>it only means that you are to begin building the bridge, for others to eventually get there.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Real Education is the first step,</p>
  <p>the second is actually many overlapping steps that will happen all at once, all around the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>What you have to do is make sure that the students get to own or hold in their own hands the many tools that they need,</p>
  <p>to learn, and explore the Human Condition, and The Sciences, and The World, and The Stars; as those are their countless bookmarks and the steppingstones to their boundless steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The children want to learn,</p>
  <p>and that is all the hope Humanity will ever need.</p>
