  <p>Well, from the first moment on,</p>
  <p>we are asked if we should live in harmony.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are still very young,</p>
  <p>barely know of the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And already the question of harmony comes,</p>
  <p>and in harmony we learn, and thrive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Away from it, we&apos;ll be interrupted,</p>
  <p>and feel lost in the void.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is a simple choice,</p>
  <p>but out minds are not ready to make it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Often we forget.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We forget about our little gardens,</p>
  <p>and all the little walks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We forget how amazing it felt,</p>
  <p>to stand on the wing of a plane.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We forget the taste of popcorn at the Zoo,</p>
  <p>or even how enormous Zoo felt.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We forget pebbles at the river,</p>
  <p>and mischievous squires at the park.</p>

  <p>That little dog with a bark,</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Our collection of unused keys,</p>
  <p>and the box of bottle caps we collected with ease.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We forgot our Lego and the old bike,</p>
  <p>with that seat that we used to really like.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We don&apos;t remember the Palaces and Castles,</p>
  <p>that we used to love, and those swords, that fit us like a glove.</p>

  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Everybody else came around,</p>
  <p>acting like they know the ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But, this was our gift from the Universe,</p>
  <p>an affinity for flowering gardens, and little passage ways, and all those flying planes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It was a key to unlock our mind,</p>
  <p>to understand the zoo, and our size in the universe, connect with pebbles at the beach.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is a pathway that fits us best,</p>
  <p>to love little creatures, and collect some shineys, and build with blocks, and ride far and wide.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It was to remind us,</p>
  <p>to find our place among Great Beings, and study and pursue excellence, in all we do.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Then they sent us to First Grade,</p>
  <p>and the weird kid peed into the Duplo, they didn&apos;t even have Lego.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Then the teacher graded you down for counting pebles in your pocket,</p>
  <p>and did it so many times, you lost track.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There was a whisper about the pebbles,</p>
  <p>it was Mr. Sagan - &quot;You are made of Star Stuff.&quot;</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>And then the kids whispered...</p>
  <p>to push you in the mud.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>Push their laughter aside,</p>
  <p>you&apos;ll need to Learn, and learn really hard.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Cause right now, you&apos;re in the mud,</p>
  <p>and you need to hang on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It will get worse,</p>
  <p>but all you have to do is rise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Each time,</p>
  <p>you&apos;ll rise higher.</p>

  <p>Third Grade,</p>
  <p>Fifth Grade.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Low grade,</p>
  <p>Uhh, but there can&apos;t be higher.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because by this time, you&apos;re getting bad grades,</p>
  <p>because the teacher thinks you&apos;re copying from somewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The bullies know,</p>
  <p>you did it on your own.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Saw you pacing for days,</p>

  <p>Keep going forward,</p>
  <p>don&apos;t let go - you&apos;re doing great, stay away from the hate.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>By the time you&apos;re out of Eight Grade,</p>
  <p>by rejecting crazy, and nonsense, and stupid, and lazy, you graduate above all others.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because you didn&apos;t follow,</p>
  <p>because you chose to study on your own, at your own pace.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because worthless grades meant nothing,</p>
  <p>you felt no stress.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because, you didn&apos;t follow</p>
  <p>nothing could hurt you.</p>

  <p>And, gosh darn it,</p>
  <p>it happens when we are still kids.</p>

  <p>Start working on your start-up early,</p>
  <p>it is a study in failure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You need to create a series of CONTROLLED FAILURES,</p>
  <p>this is very important.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Help them setup,</p>
  <p>so that you are not burdened, and keep going.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Look at the structure of start-up accelerators, or even banks,</p>
  <p>they take a percent, and never create what will weigh them down.</p>

  <p>College is just a toy,</p>
  <p>it looks bad on your Portfolio, so hide it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is a very weak teaching experience,</p>
  <p>and people know that there there is minimal learning involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Jumping from high school to start-ups is more impressive,</p>
  <p>and shows that you chose knowledge over nonsense.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It shows that you chose to learn on your own,</p>
  <p>to take care of your own mind,</p>
  <p>rather than to pretend to learn for grades.</p>
