  <p>Why does Philosophy seem so foggy,</p>
  <p>so unclear, and uncertain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Living above yourself, transcending your limits,</p>
  <p>puts you in a wiser state, more complex state, harder to understand state.</p>

  <p>I can&apos;t describe that directly,</p>

  <p>You know how your Dad questionably, pokes around a car engine,</p>
  <p>and yet all of that seems a bit foggy?</p>

  <p>Do you remember what it was like to jog the first time,</p>
  <p>and then you just kept going?</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Can you imagine your first 18 miles at the Appalachian Trail,</p>
  <p>and can you see your last 18 miles as you near Katahdin.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>You know how mathematics sound impenetrable?</p>
  <p>Until you become a mathematician?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There are gaps, discomforts, vocabularies, perceptual frameworks,</p>
  <p>that stand between you and the wisest you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You have to cross those things,</p>
  <p>to unfog your mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>

  <p>Learn to jog, to sprint, to body build,</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Learn to backpack,</p>
  <p>to walk out in front of a lone wolf, let your eyes connect in loneliness and familiarity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Snarl down a Mountain Lion,</p>
  <p>with a God Like Growl, out of you entire life force, and culminating in a Wild Howl.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let your Lycanthropy belch a low rumble as you stand your ground,</p>
  <p>to the test of a charging Black Bear.</p>
</div>

  <p>And learn from the Calm and Power of a Grizzly Bear,</p>
  <p>Ursus Horribilis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Or, become an artist. You don&apos;t need a charging bear to learn.</p>
  <p>You can use clay, or canvas, or music.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There is no finer way to push loneliness away,</p>
  <p>than to sculpt the meaning of touch.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And there is no better way to learn courage,</p>
  <p>than to paint a chain of works that inspire to motion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And music need not make someone cry to be powerful,</p>
  <p>make the beat move your own feet, as you run your first ultra.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>Consider how simple a Desktop in your Operating System is,</p>

  <p>It is right there, you can wiggle it,</p>
  <p>and yet it is trapped in a prison, of invisible walls.</p>

<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And consider, how different you are, from all the people you have met,</p>
  <p>how you don&apos;t even smile at the things that make them laugh.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>How not a single person out of the Eight Billion,</p>
  <p>could possibly take your place.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>How often it feels that all the people around you are sleepy,</p>
  <p>how some seem different, because they could not do, what they do, if they were not wide awake.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To integrate with wisdom, you cannot read the same books others read,</p>
  <p>your mind represents a perfectly unique constellation of stars.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To integrate with wisdom,</p>
  <p>not only do you have to indirectly wiggle around by subtle analogy to other things.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But you have to fish out just the perfect morsels that fit you,</p>
  <p>in just the perfect sequence, out of a unique collection of mutually reinforcing works of Philosophy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You start in the beginning, with Survey Courses, as these outline the most brilliant ideas first,</p>
  <p>there you can recognize thoughts that fit you, that you already had in your constellation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Organized Education, poisons your confidence in education, because everything they teach,</p>
  <p>is in an inhuman, synthetic, and impersonal sequence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Moreover, the easily forgotten and fragile clusters of incomplete information,</p>
  <p>aim to build on one another, they guarantee you won&apos;t understand, and will only overwhelm you in the end.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The celebrating of a Diploma, is a sacred ritual, that has been erased, and replaced,</p>
  <p>with a more sugarcoated &quot;I am finally out&quot;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is a perfect recipe for bondage, blindness, weakness,</p>
  <p>and worse.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We must not allow a fake sugar pop triumph,</p>
  <p>to replace the Real Triumph or Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It can only get worse,</p>
  <p>a day will come when the Libraries will close.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>School and Library, above all, were meant to be a symbol,</p>
  <p>an extension to your own self education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Your Education,</p>
  <p>the pathway to Peace, Safety, Security, Self Control, Harmony, Enlightenment.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>What has occurred to cause the fog, is a drop of packets of information,</p>
  <p>we are too complex, the world is too complex, parenting is too complex, teaching is too complex.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It can get worse, if we continue celebrating false graduations, and fake education,</p>
  <p>if we keep forgetting that our family, has Eight Billion members and each must grow up for real.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The solution is to remind ourselves, that growing up is not about feeling like an adult,</p>
  <p>but rather Transcending our Limits, and Pushing Through gaps, towards Wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We face problems that can only be solved by Intellectual or Cultural Unity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Problem of War, is solved by Education, Wisdom, and Unity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Problem of Education, is solved by Helping Everyone to a Fair Start.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Problem of Crime, can be Solved by Mental Heath Care, and Prevention.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Problem of Poverty and Slavery, is Solved by Universal Income.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All these problems are our problems, and the solutions are ours as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But they rest across a Gap, a gap that Humanity must cross.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And the next step,</p>
  <p>is your step.</p>

  <p>Nothing worth your precious time, can be faked, or made up, or make believe,</p>
  <p>it all has to be Authentic, Powerful, Guttural, Raw.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It will hurt in the Muscle and Bone,</p>
  <p>but eventually you&apos;ll forget to pay attention to what is unimportant.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You are not to be taught that you are dime a dozen,</p>
  <p>and that they just can&apos;t find a job for you, because you don&apos;t fit or conform.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>People believe this nonsense,</p>
  <p>because they don&apos;t have anything to draw from by subtle analogy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That is why we must challenge ourselves to Great Deeds,</p>
  <p>to acquire the experiences necessary to tell Wisdom from Waste.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When you hear someone putting you down, pushing you around, belittling you,</p>
  <p>you are to leave, because that someone has fractured and broke, and are now ill.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is the oldest and sickest trick,</p>
  <p>to convince someone they don&apos;t matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They do it for personal gain, money or laziness,</p>
  <p>to people who do not have a library of Grand Experiences from which they can draw wisdom, by Subtle Analogy.</p>

  <p>Get Up.</p>

  <p>The Highway Overpass, The Starry Beach where the Stars Come Out at Night and mingle with Starfish.</p>

  <p>And know, that you are a Child of The Universe, first,</p>

  <p>And pay attention, to the real problem,</p>
  <p>how easily you were tricked and mislead.</p>

  <p>That cannot go on,</p>
  <p>you are not a push around.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>I wish you knew how Powerful you really are,</p>
  <p>how easily you learn at your own pace in the sequence that fits you best.</p>

  <p>How All Too Human, all too familiar, all too easy,</p>
  <p>the acquisition of wisdom really is.</p>

  <p>Not all Adults are defined by Outspoken Wisdom, some find Greatness in Love Returned,</p>
  <p>and what a Great Power, can those Two even make a mistake?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I don&apos;t think there is anything other than Love, that can substitute for Wisdom,</p>
  <p>it is both The Love of Two, and The Love of a Big Mother in a large family,</p>
  <p>a Mother that always brings hugs, warm meals and Wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But, True Love is rare, so while you search, you must also grow in Wisdom,</p>
  <p>from now on, you will have to learn to tell the children apart from the adults.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And not by looking at how old they are, or how well they dress, or how sharply they move in their environment,</p>
  <p>you will now look at their Authenticity, and Content of Character.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>No one who lacks in Authenticity, or has little Content of Character,</p>
  <p>has anything to contribute to you life, certainly nothing negative.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Hope for them to recover, and become wise, and healthy,</p>
  <p>let them know that they are a Child of The Universe, and they count - but go.</p>

  <p>It will never get easier,</p>
