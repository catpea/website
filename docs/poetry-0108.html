          <p>Every one in a while I bicycle to the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/J7BhcUqsPx1wNJEBA">south end</a>,<br>
            and check if they did any work, and how it went.</p>
          <p>I always find it old, and full, of bumps thorns and grass,<br>
            no matter how hard I bicycle, there is never a way to pass.</p>
          <p>I work up this morning, and said &quot;It is time for another check!&quot;,<br>
            I got my gear together, and squirted sunblock all around on my neck.</p>
          <p>And as soon as got too far to go back,<br>
            my bicycle, creaked, and shuddered, and squeaked - and I was like &quot;What the heck?&quot;</p>
          <p>The noise came from the bottom where the pedals are,<br>
            and only the left pedal made noise thus far.</p>
          <p>And the noise would not cease,<br>
            I had the tools but no grease.</p>
          <p>So I said to my self in a deep tone &quot;It is time for Field Repair!,<br>
            and although I have no grease, I will not despair.&quot;&quot;</p>
          <p>First, I checked the pockets of my new red pants, the short ones that I like,<br>
            but there was nothing there that could fix my bike.</p>
          <p>So I looked to my day pack, and the solution sat right next to my bicycle lock,<br>
            I squeaked! &quot;I do have grease, it is in my sun block!&quot;</p>
          <p>So I squired some on the pedals and the connecting rod,<br>
            and though I admit the solution was a bit odd...</p>
          <p>I was back on the road, riding smoothly and quietly like a pro,<br>
            after all, I had places to go.</p>
          <p>I made it to the southern edge, it was 15 miles away,<br>
            they still didn&apos;t fix anything, bumps and shrubs were blocking the way.</p>
          <p>I took a photo to share with you,<br>
            just in case you were thinking about going or pushing through.</p>
          <p><img src="image/poetry-0108-end.jpg" alt="Path"></p>
          <p>The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/oRaowTwL1cdz5G549">actual ancient end of the trail</a> is not that far away,<br>
            about 2.6 miles south, but you are better off walking the rest of the way.</p>
          <p>Even better than following the ancient end, is to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/j93A21irtxaaRzd96">go to the park</a>,<br>
            and head for lake Erie, but make sure to leave early, so that you don&apos;t bicycle back after dark.</p>
          <p>The trick to make it to the lake is to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/yDvAJg3dUWX2atPY9">turn right before</a> the Nature Center,<br>
            and head through Flat Rock, to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Uq1DXX5HRwXxYtcW7">Maple Beach</a>, you don&apos;t have to pay to enter.</p>
          <p>I think of it as the real end to the trail,<br>
            reaching it always make for a good tale.</p>
