          <p>At the center of our being,<br>
            we each have a collection.</p>
          <p>It makes us unique,<br>
            but we never lose our connection.</p>
          <p>As with all things in life,<br>
            it is too easy to get lost in strife.</p>
          <p>We have to protect what makes us unique,<br>
            if you fail, your future will be bleak.</p>
          <p>With all things we do,<br>
            sometimes the bad guys slip through.</p>
          <p>This is what we need courage for,<br>
            to look them in the eyes, and slam the door.</p>
          <p>The unique collection at our center, is our power.<br>
            It transforms, and evolves, hour after hour.</p>
          <p>We start with just the Ocean, Skies, Mountains, Stars, Earth and Mars,<br>
            maybe Flowers, Gardens, Kittens, Dogs, Horses and Frogs.</p>
          <p>But then it grows, call it soul, or spirit, personality or vitality,<br>
            it becomes... Beauty, Endurance, Authenticity, Nobility, Love and Dignity.</p>
          <p>And it keeps growing, so as long as you Love Yourself,</p>
          <p>It creates Leaders, Protectors, Guides, Teachers, Dreamers,<br>
            Adventurers, Explorers and Discoverers,<br>
            Intellectuals, Humanitarians, Philosophers,<br>
            Scientists, Astronomers,<br>
            Dancers, Athletes, Bodybuilders,<br>
            Chefs, Blacksmiths, and Makers,<br>
            Musicians, Poets, Sculptors, Photographers and Filmmakers,<br>
            Artists and Designers,<br>
            Hackers and Programmers,<br>
            Genius...<br>
            Visionaries...<br>
            Founders....</p>
          <p>You have to protect what makes you unique at all cost,<br>
            if you start letting go, you will become lost.</p>
          <p>And many will come, and many with care and kindness,<br>
            and they will try to change you, in their blindness.</p>
          <p>You cannot grow up, if you start letting go,<br>
            you need an unbroken chain, you need that flow.</p>
          <p>You have to learn to say,<br>
            that it&apos;s either you, the one one who stands and is true,<br>
            or you are through.</p>
          <p>To grow up, into who you need to be,<br>
            is your right, and your dignity.</p>
          <p>To let bullies push you around,<br>
            is to fail, and falter,<br>
            and run aground.</p>
          <p>Decades, decades after they are long gone, do not let go,<br>
            do not take their turns, do not change your view,<br>
            you must aim to become worthy of you.</p>
          <p>Whether you believe in Heroes,<br>
            on that we are only Human.</p>
          <p>It is the same height,<br>
            just a maximum of our might.</p>
          <p>Push, and stand up, and aim up, and rise,<br>
            Open your eyes,<br>
            it is the only way to become wise.</p>
          <p>Fight for who you are,<br>
            because in time,<br>
            that fight is also for who you need to be.</p>
          <p>For who you need to be,<br>
            to be strong and healthy,<br>
            and unbreakable and worthy.</p>
