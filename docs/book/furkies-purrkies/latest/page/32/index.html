The writers of Space Operas that span countless generations of characters,

Don&#39;t worry, if you want something ever lasting,

You can&#39;t just make a doodle and hope it will last forever,

But pay attention to the poetry of the thing,
set your aims aside and don&#39;t cling.
You invent by combining pieces that _already_ fit together,
your invention has to be light as a feather.
It is meant to lift you out,
so you don&#39;t have to work as hard as a trout.

however magnificent.
It will be just one,
it will start in the beginning and go as far as it can into the future.
There is no time here to stay down, or stay scared, or live simple, or dream plain,
you have one life to live, and the only rule here, is that it is lived to the fullest, and most fulfilling.
Every one of you days must add to the Magnificent Whole,
sometimes to your body, sometimes to your mind, sometimes to your wisdom, and your dreams.
But you never stay...</p>

             <p class="card-text small">We are alike biologically,
and socially we are a single family.

Intellectually,
we are each unique.

Boys thinking that beer is a rite of passage, or a person assuming that they belong to a particular religion,
are both examples of making the mistake, of thinking, that we are like others.

We are nothing,
like the others, nothing.

The price Humanity pays for this mistake,
is the tragic repetition of all the other mistakes, including those that should never be repeated.

I think it is just that Programmers Are happy people.

At least when they are not being overprotective,
of the wrong languages they became good at.
Or supremely questionable program ideas,
that go out of control when they go public.

I&#39;ve been the butt of a horrible joke once,
I was briefly antiquated with a cheerful young lady with an eye for company swag.
And she dragged me along with her mom and husband to one of such event,

             <p class="card-text small">Let me just say, becoming a programmer is very easy,
you just need to stick your foot in the door.
When I was little I was very fortunate to be introduced to the supremely user friendly Commodore 64,
you flip the switch and you get a prompt[1].
And you can immediately start programming,
you also get what I call a cookbook, with very small and very clever, and useful recipes.
Good recipes will help you dream a new program up,
you&#39;ll be able to splice what you need together, out of the bits of the...</p>
