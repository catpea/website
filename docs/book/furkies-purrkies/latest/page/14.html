Fix schools, and end poverty, both at the same time,
this will help to prevent and stop most crime.

Reality is a fierce and powerful friend,

But there is other trickery at play,
one that is related to the level of our knowledge, and the content of the culture we grow up in.

This is a more formidable problem,
thus the Thinking Tools are more complex.

             <p class="card-text small">So as long as you fully accept the fact,
that a key to every Success in Life is, Happiness.

And so as long, as you take the time to help others,
to accept this Grand Fact of Life as well.

So as long as you take the time to congratulate,
those who tried to move an audience, but did not speak enough.

And so as long, as you say to them,
&#34;Next time you try to save the world, I hope you invite me to come along.&#34;
so that they know they can&#39;t lose a battle, if it is all for good.

So as long, as you are a...</p>

             <p class="card-text small">Grab onto your butts,
we are about to go nuts!

We are headed back in time,
to make a little bit of rhyme.

Do you want to know,
where and when we are going?

Greece! 425 BC,
to see about a real teacher, having a walk with his students by the sea.

Everyone else was stuck in their own life,
and Socrates too in his own way, was contemplating strife...

But he made a big breakthrough,
as he understood, how he grew.

It was all the lessons he was adding together,
while! ignoring all that did not...</p>

             <p class="card-text small">No one person can save the world,
we have to take turns because of how exhausting that is.

No one person can speak to the whole world,
the world is too complex and our voice and message will become too scattered.

We just need to keep speaking until the message of leaving bad ideas behind becomes less and less blurry.

Our problem is not so dissimilar
from the problem of a victim of a cult.

Our problem works on the same principle,
limited knowledge, limits our awareness,
limited awareness constricts us...</p>
