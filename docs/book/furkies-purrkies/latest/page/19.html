it is whether or not you use it a little or a lot.

We will each be asked to become Wise and Great,
to save the world from mediocrity and hate.

All battles for goodness are already won,
and before you know it, your great task will be done.

But first, we need to learn to reject the status quo,
set off on a quest for wisdom, and enlightenment, and go.

You never really fight in a good war,
the enemy in their madness never makes it out the door.

Or even going to the mall with your friends,

And it is a book of answers,

The light displays a blurry image,

As the beam travels along the wall,
he can imagine the entire solar system.

He knows the planet spins and rotates,
by inference from Jupiter Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

And now slowly the light,
reaches an old crystal vase.

There is a rainbow,
the beam of light is unfurled.

He&#39;s counting the colors,

At first, at best, you roll over,
to see where everything is at.

And although you can kind of lift yourself,
you can&#39;t really get up.

You sleep on the ground,
in a little tent.

That means you can,
only! stretch one limb at a time, and only a bit.

A successful decoupling and release,
requires great gymnastics.

The first order of the day,
is always fire, and a food item if you got one.

It sooo important that you start with something you like,
it can be anything flying kites, planting flowers, feeding squirrels.

There area always extras that come alongside,
and they change everything.

Flying kites, and photography will take you to droneography, possibly astrophotography,
maybe model building, drone building, custom electronics, satellite engineering.

Planting flowers can steal you away to South America,
you...</p>

             <p class="card-text small">That is the law, above all laws,
that is the rule above all rules.

That is the advice, above all advice,
that is the last sacred wisdom.

The adults can have whatever they want, and a full measure of happiness,
so as long as it does not interfere with your rise to greatness.

Whatever stands in your way, gods, royalty, governments and armies, laws,
traditions, parents, friends, schools, fairy tales, and curfews.

Is null and void,
by the power of the Universe, by the power of Reality.

the world becomes a darker place.

The bad people are sick and broken,
they only have as much power as you give them.

The more you grow in strength,
the weaker, they become.

Humans are unbreakable, just as soon as new borders are defined,
we absorb all the hardships, and enlarge our hearts and minds.

The more we are wronged, the more powerful we become,
the closer to all the other beings who fought for good.

The bad people are only broken children, they...</p>
