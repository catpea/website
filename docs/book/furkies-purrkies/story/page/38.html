Next time you&#39;re in class, look at the back row,
one of them is a genius who does not believe in the world anymore, the rest need help, the sooner the better.

I know you can prevent them from fracturing,
I know you have it in you to save the world.

All around the world, liars stretch accepted patterns they hardly understand, like a bubble gum, and with perfect deniability,

and I quote:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 8:30 a.m. by an alarm clock,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;leap out of bed, dress, force-feed, s*it, p*ss, brush teeth and hair,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Henry Thoreau, or Socrates reminds us,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that we need to know what life is, and the following quote is from Walden.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to front only the essential facts of life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to cut a broad swath and shave close,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;These are great beings, they are immortal, full of wisdom and knowledge,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is really important to - if not befriend them - then to at least answer their questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Like I said, life is so long that you are going to forget a bunch of years,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and not even feel bad about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But lowering ourselves into a decades long routine,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that we may kind of regret later on, is not good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;While life is long,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we don&amp;apos;t get a do over, so we have to make sure that we are headed towards a good and healthy future, an authentic future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;All I am saying, is that you must carefully examine life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;because there are too many people out there that will try to take advantage of your inexperience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;By examining life, by listening to great beings with large libraries of experiences, mistakes, failures and triumphs,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will learn from their life, and get a really good idea of where you really want to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And more than that,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you can take multiple paths.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;For example become a writer and a poet, first; and then go back to Med School after you crossed the Appalachian Trail a couple of times,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and after you fought some Angry Bears and Mountain Lions with little more than Courage and some sharp Nail Clippers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

and each day is a gift.

Life is not short, life is so long,
that you are going to forget a bunch a stuff, and not care.

But it is possible to run in circles;
pretend to learn, work hard at a job you hate, and never really grow up.

It is easy to avoid this,
we just need to listen to some deeply fascinating and inspiring audio books on a long, beautiful and healthy adventure.

But also, we can&#39;t really return from the adventure,
we have to continue climbing at the same...</p>

             <p class="card-text small">You really are a genius,
we are all super smart.

There are lots of tools,
that people use to create.

For example,
poetry has rhyming dictionaries.

Painting and drawing,
has art projectors that help with proportions.

In the world of sculpture,
some use three dimensional pantographs.

Music composition,
has tools like piano roll and sequencer to make composition easy.

Even abstract mathematics, physics, or elliptic curve cryptography,
is only intimidating until you find all the visualizations...</p>

             <p class="card-text small">Dear Parents,

School past elementary may not be working,
you should let your children know it is broken.

Tell them, it is still a big deal for you,
because as babysitters go, school is the best.

But be warned, if your child is getting bad grades,
then that means the school has picked you child for a stupid little sacrifice.

Let me explain why this is happening,
if school really was a babysitter...

Then your children would be safe,
but it is an institution under pressure to show results or lose...</p>

             <p class="card-text small">Existentialists say that we must give our existence a meaning,
we are not to accept what we are told to become.

Evolutionary biologists say there was once a need to listen to the elders,
it helped tribe cohesion, it got the younger ones on fast track.

Atheists say that we are not to mistake myth for reality,
no matter how comfortable it makes us feel.

Scientists teach us to question everything, reproduce previous results,
to be skeptical and free of biases, and never put opinion over fact.

Look, whatever we think we know, is almost certainly incomplete without books,
and it takes just a few months to love your way through a hundred of them.

Books are always about connection, they will either show you that you are not alone,
or they will sing to you in such a way that you will leap over several of your next plateaus.

or yearning for one, or a hermitage, or just want to be left alone.

Then you are letting people get to you,
you need to turn around and raise a shield.

It is so easy, it is ridiculous, it is right in front of you,
