beings who dedicated their lives to the betterment of Human Kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Children are forced to memorize and pretend to learn to get good grades,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and hope to go to colleges and universities that hardly live up to their promises.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Their job search, and school loans,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the way they are treated from interview to retirement does not do them justice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The younger generations are the Sacred Hope and Future of Human Hind,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but they are now exploited by old fat lice who cannot stop feeding even if their life depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The teachers in their haste to bring a little paycheck home have lost the respect for students,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;professors now sell home-made textbooks as ineffective as their lectures, and universities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The children can see all this,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they understand

to record video lectures, write and narrate books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We pay,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;for outstanding contributions and translations of these

&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Those paths,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;are the diploma.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Companies that show compassion, worth and balance,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;inspect these paths in search of talent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Even so, students are encouraged to build multi-founder start-ups,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;throughout the world and their lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;This world school, is not an neat addition to this world,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;this school: Becomes Our

erosion of the good ideas and propagation of war, poverty, and all other bad ideas is their food.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But those who stand against Prosperity, Unity, Knowledge, Wisdom and World Peace,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;are just an animated rotting corpse that needs to be left behind in the poverty and desperation they once exploited to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;For the sake of the future generations,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;let us rise

ineffective, and lacking positive, real, and permanent results.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Let us cradle the future generations in Knowledge, in Wisdom, and in Greatness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and honor them and their challenges, with World Peace.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

is charged with figuring out, what is wrong.

Previous generations discovered many wrongs,
Wars, Racism, Inequality, Lack of Education.

Due to ineffective schooling and resulting lack of education,
we continue repeating mistakes of previous generations.

The primary cause to repetitions of mistakes and their re-emergence,
is lack of real education that grants the student knowledge, independence, wisdom, and eventual greatness.

It is really important to question everything,
all the Sciences were born this way.

The sciences are a product of the Scientific Principle,
a product of the search for truth by means of real evidence, clear thinking and healthy skepticism.

Our world is changing very quickly,
but almost all the major mistakes Humanity has made, are currently being repeated.

when liars take to power; the honest become powerful.

When we face impossible problems,
someone will remind us; all human problems have human solutions.

When governments become too complex,
the Congress will call on you to help them regain their vision.

When liars start winning all the battles,
your wisdom will become even more precious.

curiosities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I write this in year 2020 when it seems that all our old mistakes have reemerged,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but what is actually going on is that mis-educated people are self assembling into desperate groups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We are seeing groups self-reinforcing each other&amp;apos;s beliefs based on color of skin,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they come together to form communities because of an imaginary superiority a color.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We have a nation that treats women with he permanent legal status of a minor,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;of someone who is less than 18 years old, and politicians do not know to become enraged by this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We have two nations that feature concentration camps,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and the Land of the Free that practices torture under the guise of enhanced interrogation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;All of this is happening because of failure of schooling,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;inability of politicians to build.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Now, let me close with a heart warming thought experiment,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;which deep down I hope some magnificent nation a thousand years in the future may try for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We can all agree that, education is an investment in a nation&amp;apos;s future,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that pretending to teach children by forcing them into memorization can destroy a nation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Let us say that, in this thought experiment, unless a better program is in place,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;countries should pay their students for achievement, not with imaginary letters but with real money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Students in elementary should be getting paid just as much money as college students,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and the amount that they bring home should be equal that of a prestigious job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;After all what is more prestigious than the child&amp;apos;s real knowledge,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a child will soon become a politician, investor, leader, and inspiration for others to follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Making some $200,000 a year in 2020 money, is an amazing way for a nation to show respect its students,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and it will proudly display how much more important they are in proportion to the defense budget.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Graduation, would leave a student not with crippling debt that can&amp;apos;t be erased with bankruptcy,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but with just about $3.2 million dollars in their account, that is how a graduate should start life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The cost of this is irrelevant, these are hundreds of trillions of dollars per year that simply add to our national debt,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;this is what it means to have a country.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;What we see today, is poverty, children going hungry, fake education, ineffective politics,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and research and legalization of dangerous drugs for the purpose of erasing stress, and PTSD born from poverty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy land,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;where it is OK for one nation to teach their children that another needs to be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy of a limited number of abstract virtual pieces of paper,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that sometimes make children die of starvation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Humanity, has outgrown the type of primitive small town thinking that we see today,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it has outgrown it probably more than a hundred years ago when large cities started growing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;For those of you who are still laughing at my though experiment,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;take a lesson from the way early internet social networks would reform themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Initially switching to more automated, more statistics and probability oriented systems,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;would set their platforms on fire and cause waves of disturbance, but that is how things adapt to growing larger.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Call it growing pains, call it Love of Humanity, call it a nation at a stand still,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in process of not just erasing poverty but creating an overabundance of wealth for its students.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Out of Love and Wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;out of Greatness of Vision, and of yearning for other nations to follow onward to World Peace, Safety and Equality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And my final words are a question, if you created a thought experiment that represented the sad state of affairs today,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;what would that thought experiment be about, and what would it be trying to prove?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

in the context of the whole world, however, education is a path to World Peace.

Education is a very unusual thing,
it enhances everything it can touch.

education is our loading program.

To borrow from computers,
education is our operating system.

Without education, we reset back to some 20,000 or 50,000 years ago,
