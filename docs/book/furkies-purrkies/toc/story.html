and remember what peace there may be in silence.
As far as possible without surrender
be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly;
and listen to others,
even the dull and the ignorant;
they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons,
they are vexations to the spirit.
If you compare yourself with others,
you may become vain and bitter;
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements...</p>

The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it.
For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one&#39;s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one&#39;s surrender to a person other than oneself.
Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it.

I want you to listen to what your conscience commands...</p>

Of easy wind and downy flake.

It was a super busy day, not a moment for tea.

And I keep Programming late into the night,

typing like a Lion with all his might.

This morn, I woke up and made Peanut Butter and Jelly,

I&#39;ve been programming all day, I keep going like the telly.

Now, I am trying to figure out, a datatype for verse,

my stanza CSS padding and margins are intense.

I am not trying to be a hero, hey!

but I am writing this, in a JavaScript Array!

I am ready to jump into my bed like a big dinosaur.

I am dressed, I am wearing my favorite workout clothes,

I stretched left and right, and fluffed up my pillows.

For tonight, I prepared, a Bill Bryson Auidobook I adore,

Even though I am already so sleepy that I could snore.

I will listen about the History of the World,

about all the mysterious things and places we explored.

This is how I go to sleep every night,

the book will slowly play......</p>

I stopped using forks,

so long ago, I forgot the cause.

I own two metal chopsticks,

I use them to eat my salads,

to scoop out Jelly and Peanut Butter,

I kid you not, I even use them as a little cutter.

And of course, I stir many a tea, or protein brew.

Making art and poetry is quite fun,

that, on computers, brevity is the Mother of Invention.

of the various little ways to get things done.

I&#39;ve been fixing bugs all day, and I feel dirty.

Now, that I fixed them all,

I must admit, I had a ball.

But, computers are slow,

My CPU is slower than a BBQ.

I tried to build a rhyming dictionary,

but it came out as an 8 megabyte webpage,

and nearly erased the internet.

In computers, everything is really bad,

but this never makes me sad, I am glad.

And now,

I took a shower,

and smell great,

my only wish,

is that I already ate.</p>

I&#39;ve been trying to invent one that tastes really nice,

the morning dew.

When there is no gym,

and ride on through,

It is magical out there,

seeing the world from the other side,

people stuck in traffic,

and here I ride.

I discovered modern architecture

of the highway underpass,

little woodland parks,

endless fields of grass.

Five miles out,

there lives an angry goose,

at seven miles,

in deep summer, angry &#39;squitoes on the loose,

Hours add up, day by day,
building, a new passageway.

I think I shall begin writing about cats,

I shall pick something more entertaining.

I can&#39;t believe that seven only rhymes with Eleven, and Heaven.

Every ten days I get stuck rhyming those two words,
and it is just about as fun as petting birds.

I was writing Bash this afternoon,
I am so full of energy, I feel like a loon.

I was so tired at eight yesterday,
I have no idea how I will fall asleep today.

I wrote a non-capturing Perl Regular Expression in sed,
gosh I miss the old Perl, I miss CGI, and I miss ed.

My salads are working great!

I have lost even more weight,

It is a marvelous diet of incredible proportions,
I don&#39;t track my calories, or even my portions.

I just make a salad once or twice,

And yes, I still continue improving and experimenting,
Today, I added Jalapenos for a little spicy augmenting.

A vegetable juice out of line.

The Tomato with Sprinkles was born of accident,
when making my salad, this is how it went;

The salad bag tore,
and some of the salad went on the floor.

But a fistful, fell in my tomato juice,
and decorated it with sprinkles of produce.

It is hard to recommend, but I must say,
it tasted great, and I&#39;ll drink it everyday.</p>

along a road, and an ancient highway.

I found an overpass where I could perch upon,
and I discovered I wasn&#39;t really alone.

I figured it was the a huge love story,
about a boy named Harold and a girl named Wally.

She was a Book Worm, a Hero, and a Graffiti Artist,
and Harold loved her because she was the Smartest!

Jogging is an art,

For each two days of training,
on the third you must pretend it&#39;s raining.

The third day is a day of rest,
and the fourth your next test.

          <p class="mb-1 small fw-light">Dear Parents,

School past elementary may not be working,
you should let your children know it is broken.

Tell them, it is still a big deal for you,
because as babysitters go, school is the best.

But be warned, if your child is getting bad grades,
then that means the school has picked you child for a stupid little sacrifice.

Let me explain why this is happening,
if school really was a babysitter...

Then your children would be safe,
but it is an institution under pressure to show results or lose...</p>

          <p class="mb-1 small fw-light">Existentialists say that we must give our existence a meaning,
we are not to accept what we are told to become.

Evolutionary biologists say there was once a need to listen to the elders,
it helped tribe cohesion, it got the younger ones on fast track.

Atheists say that we are not to mistake myth for reality,
no matter how comfortable it makes us feel.

Scientists teach us to question everything, reproduce previous results,
to be skeptical and free of biases, and never put opinion over fact.

you have to slow down, all the way down until your Heart begins calling for wisdom.

Look, whatever we think we know, is almost certainly incomplete without books,
and it takes just a few months to love your way through a hundred of them.

Books are always about connection, they will either show you that you are not alone,
or they will sing to you in such a way that you will leap over several of your next plateaus.

Books will make...</p>

Then you are letting people get to you,
you need to turn around and raise a shield.

It is so easy, it is ridiculous, it is right in front of you,
use audio books that fascinate you to become wise, and become a business entrepreneur to push poverty away.

A business entrepreneur is just someone that appreciates simplicity,
and gets things to grow from within it.

They meet up with investors,
