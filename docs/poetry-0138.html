        <p>Good to see you, my Enormous Old Friend,<br>
          how long has it been now?</p>
        <p>You haven&apos;t aged a day,<br>
          and as promised I grew in Wisdom, and Strength, and I maybe a bit Taller.</p>
        <p>I bet they finally fixed that <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7060248,-73.9967572,2a,75y,286.07h,64.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sGiVjQ4_lsY3jlLY0PM3KEA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en">achy bench</a> on the Manhattan side,<br>
          I promise to come sit, some day.</p><br>
        <p>When I came to America,<br></p>
        <p>The Bridge, Lady Liberty, and the Old Twins<br>
          kept me company.</p>
        <p>We&apos;d sit calmly together,<br>
          making excuses and promises.</p><br>
        <p>The New York County Supreme Court was my only other friend,<br>
          and I still love her dearly, but we don&apos;t speak anymore.</p>
        <p>I wanted to be a Judge,<br>
          a Philosopher King as I used to think of them - but I think better now.</p>
        <p>I think in my old age, I&apos;ll come to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.714548,-74.0024396,3a,75y,102.05h,105.41t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1smigFc8sXfFR7X-Jni_7Ogg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?hl=en">her stairs</a>,<br>
          and I will wear my suit,<br>
          and I will wear those shoes that the lawyers went up and down the stairs in - back in 96.<br></p>
        <p>I will read her words again,<br>
          &quot;THE TRUE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IS THE FIRMEST PILLAR OF GOOD GOVERNMENT&quot;,<br>
          But if she could speak, I&apos;d ask about Fair Starts, Prevention, and Rehabilitation, now.</p>
        <p>We drifted apart.<br></p><br>
        <p>I made a little pilgrimage after the Twins Feel,<br>
          I went to see if all was healing properly, and it was,<br>
          workers were preparing the site for what would become the Freedom Tower.</p>
        <p>The city was unchanged,<br>
          it was still the same people.</p>
        <p>&quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; - I said out of awe and nostalgia<br>
          as we turned to see the New York City Skyline framed in the bus window,<br>
          &quot;Damn Right&quot; the person next to me muttered.</p><br>
        <p>That broken bench on the Manhattan side,<br>
          was my bench, we connected instantly, I was breathless - it is a long walk.</p><br>
        <p>The things I&apos;d ponder about back then were supremely simple.</p>
        <p>Like, &quot;When is it going to stop raining&quot;, and,<br>
          &quot;Will they let me back on the Subway in a coat this wet?&quot;</p>
        <p>and I wanted to know more about what Ferris Bueller said;<br>
          &quot;Life moves pretty fast. If you don&#x2019;t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.&quot;</p>
        <p>But it turned out, I&apos;d never let go of a year without trying to learn something new and lasting,<br>
          years were always too precious for me, I&apos;d claw at Decembers like a cat going after his favorite toy.</p><br>
        <p>Mostly, I would sit there quietly,<br>
          watch the occasional jogger.</p>
        <p>Stare at the cars going left and right beneath me, and boats going up and down East River,<br>
          I remember always having some sweets on me, the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7060248,-73.9967572,2a,75y,286.07h,64.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sGiVjQ4_lsY3jlLY0PM3KEA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en">old bench</a> is a great place for a Picnic.</p><br>
