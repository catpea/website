          <p>My Friends,</p>
          <p>Your youth holds a great power,<br>
            a power that you can hold on to throughout your entire existence.</p>
          <p>It is the power of creating a life that you will love,<br>
            a life that will help you see with great clarity.</p>
          <p>A Life of Wisdom.</p><br>
          <p>But you must be careful,
            as the world may not yet be ready to help you.</p>
          <p>Not everyone will know about growing up,<br>
            and people will say: &quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;</p>
          <p>And they are not going to be the bad guys,<br>
            and you will be inclined to listen to their advice.</p>
          <p>And the path will be paved with good intentions,<br>
            it maybe the correct path, but it won&apos;t be the right one.</p><br>
          <p>Please, focus on building your own self,<br>
            your strength, your wisdom, your power.</p>
          <p>Focus on building the best you,<br>
            the you that you are meant to be, that the world needs.</p><br>
          <p>Because if you listen to everybody else,<br>
            you will not grow up, and they will blame you for not being able to help them.</p>
          <p>You are not going to be able to explain to them,<br>
            that you are weak because of them,<br>
            because you tried to help them too early.</p>
          <p>And if you could, all they could say will be:<br>
            &quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;</p><br>
          <p>Please, you have no choice,<br>
            but to learn to control your own future.</p>
          <p>You can try to use your imagination,<br>
            to get in touch with your Elder Self;</p>
          <p>And ask &quot;What are your regrets?&quot;,<br>
            &quot;Where did it go wrong?&quot;</p><br>
          <p>Please, carefully evaluate your choices,<br>
            wisely build your Mind and Body.</p>
          <p>Pay attention to all the choices you are making,<br>
            as they dictate the Beautiful Life Ahead of You.</p><br>
          <p>The teachers are not ready, we are not in the Era of Wisdom yet,<br>
            people are struggling to understand life.</p>
          <p>Many make choices that all too early box them in,<br>
            and not all their advice will apply to you.</p>
          <p>Not all the things that you think box people in,<br>
            actually constrain them, there are many contexts to all the paths.</p>
          <p>All lives are beautiful, and there are enough forks in the road,<br>
            for people to navigate back to where they want to be.</p>
          <p>But, when a mistake occurs, it will weigh you down for a time,<br>
            if you are careful, you can avoid the worst of it.</p>
          <p>And whatever does happen, regardless of how hard you tried to avoid it,<br>
            will not crush you, because you will know you did your best.</p><br>
          <p>Please, be careful in life, be beautiful, and strong,<br>
            learn, and think, and evaluate, and judge, and grow in wisdom.</p>
          <p>Following everyone&apos;s advice, will create a lot of noise,<br>
            listening to everything from everywhere will never align with you.</p>
          <p>You must lean to pace yourself,<br>
            and to carefully and wisely follow what interests you.</p>
          <p>Your mind is constantly asking questions,<br>
            your future depends on having a good intuition, rooted in reality, and in wisdom.</p>
          <p>There is nothing you can be force-taught school,<br>
            you will not retain things that are out of sequence.</p>
          <p>Reaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom in your own sequence, and at your own pace,<br>
            is the only way to learn, and build steps, and build on top of those steps.</p>
          <p>No one can decide what lesson you are ready for next,<br>
            that is something that comes from the complexity of your own mind.</p>
          <p>Those people who are doing well in school without cramming and memorization,<br>
            have previously arrived at those subjects in their own sequence.</p><br>
          <p>The same applies to your job, your career,<br>
            your career needs to emerge from the path you were growing up with.</p>
          <p>It needs to be an an extension of your pursuits,<br>
            it must benefit you, and help you grow.</p>
          <p>Just like you must actually learn, instead of just getting grades,<br>
            your work must add to you, and not, rob you of your years.</p>
          <p>Do you understand the value of a Single Year of Your Precious Life?<br>
            no one can put a price on that, not even you, there are not enough atoms in the Universe.</p>
          <p>That is why Harmony with Education, and Work is so important,<br>
            each year must be lived on the path that makes you grow.</p><br>
          <p>I am so sorry, that people will tell you to cram for tests,<br>
            and get a job, and get on with life.</p>
          <p>I am so sorry, My Friends,<br>
            but that is the worst, you can do.</p>
          <p>That&apos;s why you can&apos;t listen to anyone,<br>
            that&apos;s why you have to look into yourself.</p>
          <p>Carefully evaluate all decisions,<br>
            whilst carefully evaluating consequences, and being mindful of your future.</p>
          <p>You are not alone, look to Memoirs, look to Biographies,<br>
            listen to Audiobooks, Explore, and Create.</p><br>
          <p>And you must take care of your body,<br>
            the best you can, at first.</p>
          <p>And with each year,<br>
            you will gain more, and add a bit more as you grow in Health and Fortitude.</p>
          <p>Your Elder Self needs to be Flexible, and Healthy,<br>
            you may never grunt and complain, that&apos;s something you have to be mindful of now.</p>
          <p>It is not just about making choices for your Future,<br>
            but also for your body too.</p><br>
          <p>Do you see how going along with cramming for tests,<br>
            can put you in a field where your job makes life more stressful,<br>
            which will prevent you from taking good care of your body?</p>
          <p>Imagine the consequences of walking a path that is not truly your own,<br>
            and what will your Elder Self feel when you two finally become, One?</p>
          <p>Be gentle with yourself,<br>
            this is Your Life, Your Beautiful-Beautiful Life.</p><br>
          <p>Put down the incomprehensible Text Book, the standardized tests,<br>
            and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/130.Best_Audiobooks_Ever">find</a> an Audiobook that you will love and actually learn from.</p>
          <p>Stop trying to find a job or get hired, and become the kind of a person;<br>
            that companies can only hope to hire.</p>
          <p>Start living healthy, years before you start your training,<br>
            do not force your body into endurance, gradually teach it to adapt.</p><br>
          <p>Chose Audio-books that really help your wisdom grow,<br>
            embrace your hobbies, and expand your adventures.</p>
          <p>If you can&apos;t find a career path that will add onto you,<br>
            then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4JtyLKDjXk">start your own company</a>,
            or become a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRLzkbtKPGM">co-founder</a>.</p>
          <p>Take care of your body, be mindful of you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">Body Mass Index</a>,<br>
            but also aim to become a Healthy Athlete, Heath will never take away from you.</p><br>
          <p>In all we do, in choices, or intuitions,<br>
            we re driven by the wisdom we have thus far acquired.</p>
          <p>A decision that made sense in your youth,<br>
            may reverse, as you gain wisdom from Books and Experiences.</p>
          <p>The richer our Pursuit of Wisdom,<br>
            the more in-tune our decision-making.</p>
          <p>Wisdom surrounds Education, Carrier and Health,<br>
            it influences your Private Decision-making, and thus Your Future.</p>
          <p>In most contexts Wisdom is the most important thing,<br>
            what can be more important than the thing that influences your private decision making?</p>
          <p>And be mindful that your decision making is in turn,<br>
            the very thing that influences all the future ahead of you?</p><br>
          <p>The beginning of your Knowledge and Wisdom is found in the things you love as a child,<br>
            in a way those things are questions, and playing with them brings answers.</p>
          <p>But you have to stay with it,<br>
            protect the natural progression of the chain of your curiosities.</p>
          <p>You have to understand the the Destructive Power of:<br>
            &quot;cram, get a job, and get on with your life&quot;.</p>
          <p>We don&apos;t live in a world that can support your Pursuit of Wisdom,<br>
            for most, the world will give minimums, for many nothing.</p>
          <p>When we try to create external machinery,<br>
            it will often perform the minimum.</p><br>
          <p>The power for the world to change,<br>
            is within each of its Citizens.</p>
          <p>It is found in decision making,<br>
            perpetually strengthened by Unrelenting Pursuit of wisdom.</p>
          <p>We create this world together,<br>
            and it can only grow, when we grow.</p>
