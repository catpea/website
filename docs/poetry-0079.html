        <p>Universe created Evolution, Evolution created Consciousness,<br>
          Consciousness created Humans, and Humans created Philosophy.</p>
        <p>The word Philosophy, comes from the greek Philosophia,<br>
          it means Love of Wisdom.</p>
        <p>It comes from the time when Great Beings first begun emerging among us,<br>
          they rejected inauthenticity, violence, contradiction, and imaginary things and creatures.</p>
        <p>These were the First Superheroes,<br>
          they were often attacked.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0079-socrates.jpg" alt="Socrates"></p>
        <p>This is Socrates, he taught the children power of Wisdom,<br>
          he was sentenced to death, and he did not run, he died, for Wisdom.</p>
        <p>Wisdom is self correcting,<br>
          it eventually went against the State and its imaginary gods, and so the State went against him.</p>
        <p>He outlived the State by becoming immortal,<br>
          he is often seen as the Father of Philosophy, but there were many other thinkers.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0079-hepatia.jpg" alt="Hepatia"></p>
        <p>This is Hepatia, her tragedy, marks the end of the first Philosophers,<br>
          the world plunged into Dark Ages.</p>
        <p>As hard earned as Wisdom is, as long as it takes to cultivate and grow,<br>
          the criminals can take it away in a cold flash of steel.</p>
        <p>Her tragedy, should not be forgotten, the Noblest become a target,<br>
          to the fractured, and blind, and jealous.</p>
        <p>For now, Wisdom is no longer seen as the Highest there is,<br>
          today, opinion seems to matter as much as fact.</p>
        <p>There are calls to &quot;teach controversy&quot;, for &quot;equal debate&quot;,<br>
          to &quot;show both sides&quot;, to &quot;let the reader decide&quot;.</p>
        <p>Falsely presenting a broken opinion,<br>
          to be on par with the reality and fact that helps Humanity Grow.</p>
        <p>It is an old trick, it is cheap, and self assembling,<br>
          it emerges on its own from poverty, inequality, suffering, blindness, and pain.</p>
        <p>Being conscious and self aware, is not quite enough,<br>
          because of Liars, Thieves, Criminals, Murderers, War, and even Poverty.</p>
        <p>Wisdom is like a higher level Operating System for Humans,<br>
          it enhances our consciousness, it grants us unique powers.</p>
        <p>But, Every Human, each member of the Grand Human Family,<br>
          needs to see Wisdom as a necessity.</p>
        <p>Until then, racism, xenophobia, inequality, poverty, and darkness,<br>
          will keep us apart.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0079-soldier.jpg" alt="Soldier"></p>
        <p>The Stories of Superheroes are rooted in lives of Philosophers,<br>
          because a Philosopher cannot be hurt like the ordinary men.</p>
        <p>Philosophers survive for thousands of years in text,<br>
          in stories, in paintings.</p>
        <p>They survive by sharing Wisdom,<br>
          that make us stronger, that enriches us, that we each yearn for.</p>
        <p>When you read the words of a philosopher,<br>
          she or he comes round, and in a way they keep you company.</p>
        <p>Socrates knew that,<br>
          and he knew he needs to send a powerful message far into the future.</p>
        <p>An important being, died for something important,<br>
          he is signaling, that Wisdom is Your Right.</p>
        <p>He was a Soldier,<br>
          he found a way to repair the word.</p>
        <p>And it was,<br>
          Love of Wisdom.</p>
        <p>Once you begun paying attention to it all,<br>
          a constellation of stars will begin assembling in you.</p>
        <p>Each star will repair and strengthen all the others,<br>
          it will bring you health and clarity.</p>
        <p>Your contradictions will begin resolving,<br>
          by rejecting and ejecting that which makes no sense.</p>
        <p>It will help your decision making,<br>
          it won&apos;t let you move forward when two things oppose.</p>
        <p>It will keep you in place,<br>
          until you reject the one that is not fact.</p>
        <p>Where all the other stalks fracture,<br>
          Wisdom will help you bend in the colder winds of change.</p>
        <p>Foresight helps you combine knowledge,<br>
          to construct events that are yet to unfold.</p>
        <p>Moreover, it helps you construct the correct path ahead,<br>
          and reject whatever else may come.</p>
        <p>The Power of Foresight does not end with the individual wielding it,<br>
          it can extend to guiding the word to the correct its paths.</p>
        <p>Heroism is in part is about learning what not to do,<br>
          helping others requires solving their problems, and thus you learn life.</p>
        <p>But the greatest of insights are found in Memoirs worth reading,<br>
          where they are placed in correct context.</p>
        <p>With enough insight Crime for example, transforms from an impenetrable state of mind that it is,<br>
          to our need to create Walls of Prevention, so that people don&apos;t end up blind.</p>
        <p>Punishment and Revenge is not a way to treat a Human Being fractured by poverty,<br>
          or violence, or even hunger-for-food. Only prevention can work here.</p>
        <p>The power of insight shows you that while you can&apos;t go back in time,<br>
          you can prevent the little ones from ending up in the same place.</p>
        <p>In that way, you take the pain of those Punished and use it for a thing that matters,<br>
          preventing children from following in their footsteps.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0079-martorano.jpg" alt="Martorano"></p>
        <p>And we get to feel others,<br>
          we get to feel when they have been Wronged.</p>
        <p>And we get to feel what they felt, when times got tough,<br>
          and the power of Compassion makes us a Family.</p>
        <p>Who was it that gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnuoHywbaR8">George Martorano</a> that little pencil,<br>
          power of compassion is incredibly complex.</p>
        <p>You hold hands with every wronged being on Earth,<br>
          those looking to their Favorite Star, wondering if someone else is looking there too.</p>
        <p>We are, we all are, we are there with you,<br>
          You matter, your heart mattes, your mind matters, your life matters.</p>
        <p>And in Wisdom we will fix all of it,<br>
          whether we are ready to recognize that or not, we are a Family, and as One, We&apos;ll fix it all.</p>
        <p>In that path we slowly walk together,<br>
          towards Happiness and Fairness, and Joy.</p>
        <p>We will erase poverty and slavery with Universal Income and a Free Home with a picket fence.<br>
          We will erase crime with Care and Prevention, and Fairness.</p>
        <p>We will erase war, blindness and stupidity, with Family Love and Wisdom.<br>
          We will erase all problems that plague the Human Family, it is what a family does.</p>
        <p>One day, the world will stand united in fact,<br>
          as opposed to being divided by opinion.</p>
        <p>Not even the Universe can stand in our way,<br>
          our way is the Human Family Way.</p>
        <p>Like Wisdom,<br>
          we are Unstoppable.</p>
