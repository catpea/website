      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Authenticity Helps Us Learn</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Authenticity would be Wonderful on its own,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it helps with trust, admiration, knowing, feeling.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, actually, it is far more than that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it reflects Fundamental Principles of The Universe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a very big difference, between crossing a real bridge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and a fake one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Or, reading a book for real, and pretending to read.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or, studying a Field of Science and, and cramming for a test.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or, doing something for a grade, and doing something for your mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or, doing something for real, and pretend to do something.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or, being your complete self, and being what others approve of.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The one thing in common here, is one is a fantasy that ends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the other, just is ... and grows, and alters the course of life ahead.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a testament to our connection with the Universe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that an Authentic Human Being will grow Healthy and Strong, and Keep Expanding.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The best example of this is getting an education that looks great on paper,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but does nothing for interacting with the real word.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A similar example has to do with a great job that pays well, that goes great,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but halts a person's development, and robs them of their youth, dreams, and hopes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">robs them of the highest version of themselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Time, cannot be warped, or faked,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it ticks away, our bodies grow, day by day, year by year, decade by decade.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The long-vision of becoming of ourselves, will reveal that the first and foremost,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and most dominant and meaningful thing, is our acquisition of wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Acquisition of Wisdom is deeply connected to Authenticity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Courage, Dignity, Nobility, Pursuit of Knowledge, Rising, Growing Up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Time helps our bodies progress forward,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it is Wisdom that helps our Minds.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Authenticity, gives us this incredible power to start something today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that will make us Wiser, Healthier, Happier, Filled with More Insight.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And not merely tomorrow, but for all our time to come,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as in Authenticity, each day adds to the previous.</div>
