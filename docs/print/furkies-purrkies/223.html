    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Programmers</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They were students, researching, thinking, learning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they were not renowned scientists, they were just bored programmers looking for a challenge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Something greater than mathematics, or algorithms, or languages,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they were looking for something more than any of their computers could simulate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So they started programming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">programming a class of machines that could repair and rebuild themselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Really basic stuff, the machines would rely on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whatever they could absorb from their environment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They needed to survive indefinitely,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">machines that could make machines, and repair, and renew.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A few milestones down the road,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they started thinking about practical applications.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They created tiny capsules that could be launched into already accelerated asteroids,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and even though the capsules were tiny, they had the ability to make countless copies,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and build bacterial colonies large enough to Terraform distant exo-planets.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Upon reaching a nearby stars,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">capsules would disperse from forces of gravity and solar radiation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually land on the nearby exo-planets,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and begin executing their adaptation routine and create copies uniquely bound to the local chemistry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The programmers setup a simple sequence of steps that would either induce early death,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or later reproduction, with pushing the more adapted information onto the offspring.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All because, there was nothing they could do to create something that would outlast time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">everything decays, we are all bombarded with radiation, protons and muons, and asteroids.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To create something lasting,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it would have to renew it self, rebuild adapt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It would have to self assemble into colonies or microbiomes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">destroy the problematic, and promote the more adapted.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And spread, and grow, and continue adapting,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the DNA system was noisy enough to allow all kinds of variation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was nothing else that could work,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">only cellular machinery could adapt without radio, soldering irons, without a forge, without tools,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">without a source of heat even, without hands, or brains.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Getting the propulsion systems to work was just as amazing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">anything that whizzed by from small meteors to comets and large asteroids was infused with the capsules.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They even used lasers to accelerate some of the capsules to relativistic speeds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the cells stored inside the capsules barely noticed any passage of time at all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually, everything that could sustain DNA based life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">was filled to the brim with it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Comets, meteors, asteroids would further spread the little machines,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">galaxies became cross-contaminated multiple times.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Life is everywhere,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and everywhen.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Virgo Cluster did not receive the original genetic material,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have evolved across countless solar systems and many galaxies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The capsules contained a lot more than generic programming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they contained instructions on how to establish an interface with it, and maintain it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And they contained instructions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">on getting back Home, to Methuselah Prime.</div>
