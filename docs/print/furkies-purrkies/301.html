  <p>It is not always necessary to accurately map the affairs of the World.</p>
  <p>sometimes all you need is a vision of a better one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The world is difficult to grasp because people in authority,</p>
  <p>have interests that differ from, the people that vote on them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Furthermore, low quality schools,</p>
  <p>will prevent the voter from making correct choices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The uneducated or misled majority,</p>
  <p>will always be incorrect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is why independent, self education,</p>
  <p>be it in addition or as a replacement of the national one is a wise idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Independent education is one that is paved with curiosities,</p>
  <p>and helped along with top-selling non fiction, including narrated books.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Majority of world&apos;s top selling books</p>
  <p>are written by well educated and well meaning authors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Lack of education breeds desperation,</p>
  <p>not only will the voters be confused, but the politicians won&apos;t understand them either.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A world where leaders place their needs above the people they swore to represent,</p>
  <p>and do the bare minimum for maximum personal gains, is a world that needs vision.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>On the other hand, a well educated, knowledgeable and wise voting majority,</p>
  <p>isn&apos;t one to get confused, or become mislead, easily.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

  <p>A vision is always something that most of humanity has already agreed on,</p>
  <p>though they might have forgotten parts here and there, or worded them differently.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Climate Stabilization</p>
  <p>Human Dignity</p>
  <p>World Peace</p>
  <p>Universal Human Rights</p>
  <p>World Disarmament</p>
  <p>Functional Education</p>
  <p>End Of Poverty All Around The World</p>
  <p>Universal Basic Income</p>
  <p>World Unity</p>
  <p>Justice</p>
  <p>Authenticity, and Truth.</p>

  <p>As we progress from well-read, to knowledgeable, to wise, and onward to our greatness,</p>
  <p>we will collect and hold in our hearts many such Hopes and Dreams.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>At first they may seem like words or beautiful ideas,</p>
  <p>but as we look into Memoirs, and beloved and honored works of great story tellers, they will become more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>With a few dozen books a concept that has been lost on leaders of humanity,</p>
  <p>will come to life in our hearts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Rather than trying to flawlessly comprehend the world,</p>
  <p>which may not be possible due to too many liars who by definition lack in vision, and are merely responding to stimuli for maximum self gain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We gain the ability hold up several of our most beloved Aims, Hopes and Dreams,</p>
  <p>and ask what are the leaders doing to fulfill them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is much easier to look at a leader&apos;s sum of history,</p>
  <p>and notice that they have never done anything meaningful for World Peace and Elimination of Poverty, than to await their promises to come true.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We can then ask, if we want to vote on people who do not recognize World Peace and Elimination of Poverty as an aim,</p>
  <p>and what those people must be like.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>More importantly, holding a meaningful vision helps us grow up stronger and faster,</p>
  <p>helps us focus our energies and curiosities on things that we become passionate about.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When a wise voting majority becomes passionate about Human Dignity,</p>
  <p>the strength that arises from Unity of Vision can easily repair World&apos;s Nations and help Humanity Grow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without a wise consensus things that are concurring around the world are probably mostly random,</p>
  <p>with elections won by those who spend most money on taking on a pleasing shape, and disasters being a predictable result of corruption and shortsightedness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is hard to blame leaders and voters for something as disabling as lack of education,</p>
  <p>people who lack knowledge pave their ways with their best intentions, alas Humanity&apos;s most beloved works of non-fiction must come first, lest we continue repeating the same old mistakes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There is nothing difficult</p>
  <p>about falling in love with Good Ideas,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When we take to Adventures and Books, and a new book surprises us with a like selection of Hopes and Dreams,</p>
  <p>we can only discover how connected we all really are, that we are in fact one big family.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>What are your Hopes and Dreams?</p>
  <p>What is your Vision of The Future Of Humanity?</p>
