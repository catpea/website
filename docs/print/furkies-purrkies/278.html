      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Real World Real Future</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We, or the younger generations may find ourselves in situations where life does not make sense,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where too many things are contradictory, ineffective, and too broken to be of any real use.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When we are children we are taught falsehoods,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">indoctrinated into religions, made to think of politics as special, and schools as critical.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have no chance to question anything,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have no experience at all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Religions, broken politics and ineffective schools feed on blind belief,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if we taught children the truth they would try to help the world grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Plus, it does not take very long before life gets real, with bullies, rockets, wars, or illnesses,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and when we are placed on an imaginary foundation, we can't quite fight all that back, not very effectively.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Educated or not, Human Beings are still very special, and will fight for what little they know,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a terrible tragedy when people fight for something imaginary, that in the end, means nothing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just out of respect for children, and for the future generations to whom this planet truly belongs to,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must resist propagating fantasies and myths.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The governments are not external forces, and they are not fully functional,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are made to be ran by the people of their nations, and depend on schools that produce real results.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can't teach the younger generations that World Peace is a funny fantasy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">World Peace has been the next important step for a century now.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Levels of education, wisdom, and greatness all around the world, need to increase,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">while schools do work to some degree, they mean little when compared to self education and real results.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is cruel to teach children lessons that will frighten them with a world that does not make sense,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all-the-while real life is happening and they need real facts and not imaginary opinions and wishful thinking.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Worst of all, we propagate myths because it is easier to pass on a faerie tale,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">than to read a thousand books about the world and growing up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us all put an end to this cycle to strangeness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">let us all aim to become self educated with world's finest books and lectures, onward to becoming wise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us inspire the younger generations with facts and not mere opinions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and let us remind, that the world and the politics and schools that demand great repairs, all belongs to them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">May we all rise and rise,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">until the world becomes wise.</div>
