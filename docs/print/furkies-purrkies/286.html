    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Tricksters, Memoirs, and Repairs</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The best way to win against a liar, is to never meet one,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the simplest way to "win" is not to play their game.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is extremely easy, because avoidance of liars entails a path that they will never walk on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">liars will never walk on the path of Knowledge, Invention, Hard Earned Accomplishment, Wisdom, and Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One example of a good liar is that good old Wild Wild West snake oil salesman,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they were probably selling cheap sugar and cheap moonshine, because it was cheap to make and didn't cause much headache.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But it, looking like an expensive medicine, and costing like one,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when people felt it in their system, they automatically assumed it was working.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is still going on, and when I was a teenager I actually bought a skin cleanser,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">at a pharmacy, in the US, that in no uncertain terms, stated that this was homeopathic medicine,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Home and medicine, sounded good to me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it seemed to have been a gentle soap, but it was just the cheapest thing that they could possibly put in a tube.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I checked the top three pharmacies in the US in 2020, and heart-breakingly,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they all continue selling homeopathic "medicine".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Knowledge and Wisdom, and the path it entails,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is the most wonderful and safest way to avoid all this nonsense.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because once you become more knowledgeable than the liar,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will be able to hear them bending words, and twisting stories, the way your Mum was able to pick up on subtle cues when you were lying as a baby.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, past some point in an education, many, or perhaps most people, front healthy skepticism first,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not because they assume everyone is a liar, but because they wonder if someone might not have tricked themselves into a falsehood like I did with my homeopathic "medicine".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">More than that, when I was a teenager, and someone asked me if <span>Mokele-mbembe<sup>[1]</sup></span> existed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would whole heatedly, and with all the love in my heart, say:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"I hope so, after all, it is not a question of their existence, is it now? They used to exist millions of years ago.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is a question of whether or not there is one or two, left in Rhodesia." - with a heavy and hairy accent, whilst bouncing my unibrow up an down.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Anybody asking me about cryptozoology was better off,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">fronting mountains of skepticism first - the brontosaurus was my favorite dinosaur!</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And get this, Brontosaurus is no longer the same thunder lizard we are all familiar with,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was a misclassification, the dinosaur that you think of as Brontosaurus is actually called Apatosaurus now.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In context of liars, which are pretty damn scary, and only get more frightening as they come together in groups,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">...searching for forgiveness, reinforcement and easy pickings to whatever their disorder is; we need to take to knowledge and wisdom as soon as possible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Middle school, is a pretty good time to start learning for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and start climbing over everyone's heads, to get ahead of things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Books narrated by their authors,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are an especially precious gift of knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Bill Bryson has some nice and funny books that help people grow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A Walk in the Woods, A Short History of Nearly Everything, The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, and In a Sunburned Country, are beautiful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But it is best that you start with what moves you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">look at various best seller lists, and keep an eye on non-fiction of you can.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And climb, keep searching for that next book that will agree with you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and explore everything, explore the world, the trails, the libraries, all the places of knowledge, wisdom and greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It does not take many books to get ahead of liars,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it only takes a few more to get ahead of those that don't know they are causing harm.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And here the handful of your beloved Memoirs, Biographies, and adventure books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will transform, to your Sword and Shield, and you will fell many a monster and dragon, onward to a cheerful future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Start learning on your own, not just to avoid liars and crappy people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but to become you, the person that you are predisposed to be.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As you grow, there will be some mild regrets, but it is not going to be anything huge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and whatever you do end up missing by taking your own less traveled road...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Use is as a compass, just because you missed something, it doesn't mean you can't find it again,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">feeling like you missed something is a beautiful call to new adventure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing to be scared of, by choosing the path of Knowledge, Wisdom, and maybe Greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">those are the very components by which humanity grows.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our superpowers that grant us the abilities to prevent suffering.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">making our pains count for more by fixing the problems that hurt us, and preventing others from falling into the same trap.</div>
