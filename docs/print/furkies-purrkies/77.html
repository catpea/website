      <img style="display: inline;" src="../../image/md-poetry-0077-illustration.jpg" alt="Universe and You" title="Universe and You">
      
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Universe and You</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nothing is what it looks like,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because Human Beings, are not of the world of sequentially predictable machines.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Human Beings emerged, out of infinitely increasing complexity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by rules of infinite accidents along lines of fuzzy principles.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a word, we are here because the Universe mixed it self for so long</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that the failure for life to occur became inconceivable.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And, we want to believe life emerged, on Earth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just like we wanted to believe that earth was the center of the Universe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we want to believe that Earth was the first to have life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">my goodness, how much more special could we be, the first in the Universe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Universe is a large place, that has been around for a long time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is better not to think of anything cosmic, as that! special.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But there is one exception.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you come down to Earth, come up to Life, and look then Into The Conscious Self Aware Mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is no longer a common occurrence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing normal about it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are now at the limits of what the Universe could possibly conceive of.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No machine or hybrid can measure up to the raw power of unleashed consciousness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nothing partially conscious, can know the depth of Sadness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">nothing less than conscious could know the Miracle of Happiness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are used to thinking of ourselves as work horses,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">great locomotives that can plow through Pandemics, or a Broken Heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But that is a temporary oversimplification just to keep visions clear,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">born of a finely tuned mind that can narrow all views down to the important bits.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Focus and selective attention is not a limitation of our mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a feature that clears away unimportant things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When we need recall, we can have it in full,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just imagine your favorite place, and trace along the walls.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every window, picture, appliance, and outlet, all the important knickknacks are all there,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we don't have memory problems, we don't need better brains.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The convergence that we need is not about integrating with technology,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but combining the good parts of our cultures, so that the world can learn towards Peace.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without that shared wisdom, people are easily tricked to believe in conflict,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">into the belief that there are borders, and across borders they must fight.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By not helping each other to understand how special and unique we each are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there grows a vocal minority of machine like minds, that think in mechanical terms.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They add to get more, they take to be more,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they divide to make enemy, and subtract enemy to spread more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They think they are a cog, in a bigger machine,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but there is no machine, just that blind mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is OK to focus on just a few things so that we may grow, and grow in wisdom too,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it is not OK to live in some narrow channel for simplicity sake.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It actually isn't OK to do things to simplify,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">complexity only moves in one direction.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing healthy that can be done to un-mix a cup of tea,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is nothing useful to be found in moving backwards in time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Complexity grows, and to make sense of growing complexity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we cannot hope to simplify it, but rather adapt our minds to grasp it more efficiently.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The World must Go Forward, Move Forward,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what needs to change is out Tolerance for Bad Ideas.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But growing up to the challenges of ever increasing complexity requires wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and wisdom cannot be manufactured, it must be grown.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom is a product of Love,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not the Beating Heart, but the Human Capacity to Love the Universe, The World, and The Human Family.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My Dear Readers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Becoming a Great Being, becoming Wise and Enlightened,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is the actual definition of being an Adult.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Pretending to be an Adult, by acting mature,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to make a fool of yourself, probably while throwing away what makes you Beautiful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Throwing away your Sweetens, and Foolishness, and Innocence, and all the Smiles that happen for no reason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That's not growing up, that's the worst thing you can do to your self, and is probably very unhealthy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To become an Adult,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to become a Philosopher.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Philosophy is about Loving Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is your Wisdom not the most precious thing within you?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Universe, the biggest thing there is, in all it's might and complexity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a thing so powerful, that it may in some part, travel around it self in time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It can't do wisdom, best it can do is Evolution,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it can't do wisdom, it cannot know, it doesn't know such a thing could exist.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And each and every one of us has the capacity for it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a volitional faculty to bring up a folder of your Noblest Thoughts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are more powerful than the Universe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the only thing that can keep you down,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is you never becoming aware of your Great Power.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know Superman comes to mind when you think of Superpowers and Superheroes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But do think Superman is actually super because he can lift or fly?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If Superman was as super as he needs to be, he would become Human,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and build Schools to prevent War a Hundred Years before it happened.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He'd then age, so that the Little Ones,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">would listen to him without dismissing him as a Genius that lives on cloud nine.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He'd then let the little ones build with a thousand minds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what his one mind, couldn't grasp.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The greatest of superheroes, would encourage us to build things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that help the world to converge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">on Cultures of Wisdom that leave bad ideas behind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I ask you, My Dear Readers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to begin moving towards becoming Great Wise Beings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">towards growing up by means of searching for wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">growing all the way up so that you stand as Authentic Adults.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And rising to the challenge of inspiring a thousand minds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to accomplish what your one mind, can only barely conceive of today.</div>
