    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">We Are An Important Link Between Past And Future Generations</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The present belongs to the current generation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">therefore the current generations can be said to be the most important.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Much is to be said on the subject of the great mistakes of the most recent century,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and just as importantly much is to be said about the mistakes we are repeating.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">History books are waiting to be read,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they will help us understand current events across all nations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To correct things, however,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is much more difficult.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is because we were born into the world long after things were put in motion,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the people in charge have not been granted the needed wisdom to understand their role.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To put it simply,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is too late to teach the blind or corrupt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Individuals who take part in harming the world, or preventing it from growing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are too far invested, too long gone to be helped.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it is a matter of help.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Those who advertise products, that they know cause cancer or other illnesses, are sick, their minds are broken.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they all once had an opportunity to become heroes, but they didn't know it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think we can assume, that in most situations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a human being will choose Goodness over Evil,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">unless they lack the Wisdom to tell the difference between the two.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The solution to all out problems is to first understand that we were born too late into all this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the momentum of Climate Change and Business as Usual, Mass Incarceration and Poverty was too high to be stopped by a singe generation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But it is hardly a challenge for a Wiser World,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a world that helps children to wisdom so that they can become Great Beings come their middle age.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can't say the word "poverty" and sound like it is a cruel world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to make it clear that it is a broken world looking for New Heroes, New Intellectuals, and New Leaders.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can't say the word "prison" and make it sound like that's where bad people go,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to show our pain, and speak about how no Human belongs in a cage, how they needed a fair start,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and how prisons can only make a bad person worse.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can't talk about climate change as something that has no real solution in sight,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but rather we have to say that adults today are not educated well enough, their minds are not great enough to comprehend the scale of the problem.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The world in its complexity, made it so that all of these heartbreaking problems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">double as a challenge, an opportunity to not just grow in wisdom to fix these problems, but to grow in Greatness as well.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The mistakes of today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when presented as such become an opportunity to help a generation grow far beyond what we perceived as our own limits.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whenever there is a problem that is too great for a generation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">know for certain that multiple consecutive generations will fix it, in their hard earned wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My Friends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is yet another reason to take to Books and Audio Books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to study best we can, so that we may teach.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We maybe just a chain link in a world with many problems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but even a single chain-link keeps it all connected.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Slow down, I know you are working hard,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">slow down to a speed that lets you read books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">read, learn, and rise to the challenge of inspiring generations to their greatness, and their destiny as teachers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The momentum of the mistakes of today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will lose force in proportion to our ability to inspire the younger generation to greatness;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">our ability to show them just how important they are, to the past, the present, the future, how it is all inseparable together.</div>
