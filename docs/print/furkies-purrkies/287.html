    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Education in the context of an individual is the path to wisdom and greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in the context of the whole world, however, education is a path to World Peace.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Education is a very unusual thing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it enhances everything it can touch.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To borrow from movies,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">education is our loading program.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To borrow from computers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">education is our operating system.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without education, we reset back to some 20,000 or 50,000 years ago,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we end up living in villages and inventing gods to help with harvest and afterlife.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Organized and mandatory education is a recent invention,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it works up to middle school where teachers begin hiding inexperience behind abstractions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When teaching a class of multiple students there is only time for lowest common denominators,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">everything gets hurried along and those who can't understand something begin memorizing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Within a few years everyone is temporarily memorizing everything to be sure they graduate,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">those who try to learn, are graded down under the threat of being held back and repeating the year.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody is learning anything useful, everyone is memorizing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and teachers, grades, and threats of being held back only reinforce memorization.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is not education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is memorization, acting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our loading program does not load,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">our operating system does not initialize.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">System crashes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and fathers eagerly send their boys to kill boys of other fathers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Politics becomes infested with pretenders, actors, con-men, and simple liars,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">voters simply don't think about electing people who show wisdom, who share books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Lack of modern knowledge and the stress it begets will slow people down,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it will be difficult to become wise, it may not be possible to become great.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Failure to propagate modern knowledge, seems to take the shape of,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">an uneducated majority, and a tiny educated minority without any voting power.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once the failure of education takes hold,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">nothing can be done to fix the anomalies that occur afterwards.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The only way to help things along is to avoid the emergence of anomalies in the first place,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that means having a functional educational system.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If it is not possible for a nation to teach its children,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if the dream of organized, mandatory and standardized education is not realistic.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Personalized computer based, self education must be put in its place,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the transition can be made easy by transitioning from grades to money, credits, or bonds.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The initial computer based curricula would grow the same way the world encyclopedia did,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a little bit at a time, from all directions, as students are rewarded for following their curiosities.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I write this in year 2020 when it seems that all our old mistakes have reemerged,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but what is actually going on is that mis-educated people are self assembling into desperate groups.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are seeing groups self-reinforcing each other's beliefs based on color of skin,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they come together to form communities because of an imaginary superiority a color.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have a nation that treats women with he permanent legal status of a minor,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of someone who is less than 18 years old, and politicians do not know to become enraged by this.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have two nations that feature concentration camps,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the Land of the Free that practices torture under the guise of enhanced interrogation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All of this is happening because of failure of schooling,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">inability of politicians to build.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, let me close with a heart warming thought experiment,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which deep down I hope some magnificent nation a thousand years in the future may try for real.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can all agree that, education is an investment in a nation's future,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that pretending to teach children by forcing them into memorization can destroy a nation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us say that, in this thought experiment, unless a better program is in place,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">countries should pay their students for achievement, not with imaginary letters but with real money.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Students in elementary should be getting paid just as much money as college students,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the amount that they bring home should be equal that of a prestigious job.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">After all what is more prestigious than the child's real knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a child will soon become a politician, investor, leader, and inspiration for others to follow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Making some $200,000 a year in 2020 money, is an amazing way for a nation to show respect its students,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it will proudly display how much more important they are in proportion to the defense budget.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Graduation, would leave a student not with crippling debt that can't be erased with bankruptcy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but with just about $3.2 million dollars in their account, that is how a graduate should start life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The cost of this is irrelevant, these are hundreds of trillions of dollars per year that simply add to our national debt,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is what it means to have a country.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What we see today, is poverty, children going hungry, fake education, ineffective politics,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and research and legalization of dangerous drugs for the purpose of erasing stress, and PTSD born from poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy land,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where it is OK for one nation to teach their children that another needs to be destroyed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy of a limited number of abstract virtual pieces of paper,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that sometimes make children die of starvation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity, has outgrown the type of primitive small town thinking that we see today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it has outgrown it probably more than a hundred years ago when large cities started growing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For those of you who are still laughing at my though experiment,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">take a lesson from the way early internet social networks would reform themselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Initially switching to more automated, more statistics and probability oriented systems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">would set their platforms on fire and cause waves of disturbance, but that is how things adapt to growing larger.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Call it growing pains, call it Love of Humanity, call it a nation at a stand still,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in process of not just erasing poverty but creating an overabundance of wealth for its students.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Out of Love and Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">out of Greatness of Vision, and of yearning for other nations to follow onward to World Peace, Safety and Equality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And my final words are a question, if you created a thought experiment that represented the sad state of affairs today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what would that thought experiment be about, and what would it be trying to prove?</div>
