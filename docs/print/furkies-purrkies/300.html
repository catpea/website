</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Write, write, and protect your journals,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not make the same mistakes that those who have been permanently lost to history, made.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">and with all respect, Dear Reader:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you feel, that you can't yet write about your life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then that can only mean, that you have not yet lived, and that you are in danger.</div>
</div>
