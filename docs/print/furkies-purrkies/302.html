    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Learning</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Life is not meant to frighten you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is meant to become your most Beautiful Work Of Art.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even if we had perfect governments and perfect schools,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and became perfectly educated...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">...it would still be better for us all, and the universe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you stopped following and begun leading to become the Best You.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Yeah, I guess you can't be a Doctor then,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but being a Doctor is not as lasting as becoming a Great Being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A great being can heal entire generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">reminding them of vision, wisdom, and of importance of an examined life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Very few professionals can go that far out of their way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we all need help with Heart, or Fear, or Answers, and the Art of Existence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A career will not help you make sense of life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and there will be many challenges as we progress on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Is it really that foolish to say that Wisdom should come first,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that we should get a solid grasp on things before setting aims?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I suppose that wisdom takes a relay long time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but that's not a good reason to make it second to aims we set in High School.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We all agree that we should all be judged based on the content of our character,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Knowledge and Wisdom is a pretty good way to make it Beautiful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And things like Fear, Loneliness, or Sorrow cannot be helped by a career,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no matter how well it pays - being Human always comes first.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Only knowledge and the many components of wisdom contained within us</div>
  <div class="paragraph">can help us rise to the great many challenges of life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning to become Knowledgeable and Wise is so wonderful,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we just take our audio books on long winding nature trails, and sandy beaches.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We bring our graphite and drawing notepads, even canvas, acrylics and oils,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and all the questions, that we struggle finding answers to in the midst of haste.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we learn, on beautiful evenings thick with oxygen, and energizing mornings rich with crisp cool air,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so as long as we have access to books that help us inherit wisdom from countless other lives, so that we need not start at zero - we learn.</div>
