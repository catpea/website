    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Horizons, Knowledge, and Predispositions</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We expand our horizons by adding new experiences and reading new books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">doing new things, going to new places, and challenging ourselves with new adventures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our predispositions, life experiences, existing knowledge, what we do and where we are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">our curiosities and triumphs as well as failures, choose what comes next.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The expansion of horizon is a poetic way of indicating growth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">increased cognition, enhanced instinct, and out limitless and ever enlarging body of knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A poetic way of describing predispositions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a compass with a finely tuned needle.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Though rare, sometimes predispositions are about negative experiences,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for example being smittened by all the things the Army Recruiter lies about at the Mall.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Underestimating the beautiful Appalachian or Pacific Crest Trails, is another example,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is better to section hike a little bit at first, some take many years to section hike the whole thing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But you know, as our horizon enlarges, even a tepid military experience can translate to greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">working with governments to protect endangered species from dangerous poachers is one beautiful example.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Following our compass, and expanding our endless horizons will transform us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">our predispositions will bloom like fields of wildflowers, colorful, unstoppable, unbreakable, endless.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And here I must state, in no uncertain terms, that I believe that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">following a compass needle that is set by somebody or something else, will deeply hurt us, send us into sadness and regret.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We all start with a tiny and wobbly compass,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the littlest of horizons.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps a penchant for disassembling favorite toys, and an impeccable library of all the outstanding places that are somehow unusual,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">from a cracked spider web filled WWII bunker to every river bridge that you can get under and get filthy from.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to cake care of who we are, and become more of it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because that expands our horizon in the most magnificent of ways.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The dusty bridges turn to dusty trails,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">toys become your endless computer programs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You become an adventurer,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and an artist, and then so much more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I suspect, we will run out of road,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if we follow an alien path.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are filled with gentle and unique predispositions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that will bring you great wisdom when examined.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Until you do follow your dreams and arrive at all the shores that call to you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you won't really know what it is that you will become capable of, but it will be something far greater than you can image.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A great horizon, a great library of knowledge that helps you reason about new things by subtle analogy to what you already know,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">takes you beyond one word guesses of wishes like lawyer, soldier, or doctor, in to the world of Presidents and Prime Ministers, Peace Makers, and Scientists that further Human Kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if it so turns out that the world is not yet ready for who you become,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then you become a part of a bridge that aims to cover that gap, or restore something that has gone lost.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A President that the world is not yet ready to elect will work to help the world grow, a Peace Maker will aim to remind the world we are one,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a Scientist that does not yet have the necessary tools and research, will work to invent them for those that are sure follow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must listen to our hearts, to our curiosities and learn to no end, look how much more you are than the child you once were,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that child could not have grasped the complexity of your being today, and you today, cannot grasp the complexity and beauty of your wisest self... keep learning, and keep following your own dreams.</div>
