    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you were a baby you could see the world well enough,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but what made a difference was watching it for a while.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By observing the world we made sense of it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we noticed how things connect; and learned to participate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But we are also very good at becoming better,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we won't notice a mis-observation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Overwork, is one such thing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it makes everyone proud and happy, and it makes sense to try to make them even happier.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, that is a mistake,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because your Life, your Living, and your search for meaning is far more important.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to continue observing the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we can't just keep going forward based on observations we made as children.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to notice that Poverty is a stupid problem,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it should not be a part of modern society.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one should be homeless, no one should ever be hungry,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and no one should suffer from a sustained thereat of poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It will only eve get fixed if you stop overworking,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and start growing all the way up until you become a Great Being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we have to look at life from the point of view of Universe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is the Greatest Thing, there cannot be greater.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Cosmos gave birth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have emerged out of chaotic atoms and their configurations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not just a disgrace to surrender our minds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but also some kind of a Cosmic Crime.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A mind must grow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to no end, and nothing is allowed to stop it. or hurt it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Only from continued observation, and unimpeded growth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will we absorb enough of our surroundings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and inherit enough from the books that touch us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to find our "meaning" for the lack of a better word.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">MEANING, is the thing we notice when we look back from within the winter of our life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is our Greatest Thing from the Greatest Time of our Life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Overwork, fatigue, confusion, being too tired to learn or read,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">being too scared, or too worried,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or focusing on things that are just unimportant in the end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Will interfere with our growing up, and our search.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Please be careful my friends, be especially mindful of uttering these words,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, I can't do that anymore, I have a job now.".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Becoming a professional is useful though not required,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nurse, Mechanic, Programmer, Business Founder, it is all very interesting, captivating,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it is not that big of a deal - your Elder Self may see that as "very little".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My Dear Friends, having a career and some savings, is the least we can do in life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are all capable of doing, a million times more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it does not mean that our greatest achievements will take a long time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no, sometimes it only takes five or ten years, maybe even less, maybe two.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But it will be that defining creation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that will make all our previous works seem a million times smaller.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Socrates, Newton, Nietzsche, Rand, Dawkins, Sam Harris, Craig Venter (to name a few),</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are not super human, are not geniuses.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They just didn't let overwork interfere with their mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they didn't become the best employee, or the best student.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They observed The World, The Universe, The Earth, The Life, The Human,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and made their GPA or Promotion, a million times less important.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In favor of the chain of things that really moved them in their deepest integrity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What is your Elder Self trying to say to you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what are her regrets?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Is she saying "Work more?", "Get more savings.", "Put yourself in harms way for that promotion!",</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">or is she saying "Pay attention to the Minds around You",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Read more, so that you may inherit the wisdom from the lives of other people.",</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My Friends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">make time, fight for time, make serenity, clear your mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that you may get to that book, and the next one after that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not merely busy yourselves with what everybody else is doing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are not a rive, you are not to flow into the sea.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are a Universe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A Universe of Journeys and Adventures, Wisdoms, Curiosities and Passions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a unique constellation of ever birthing stars,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and no one will ever be like you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not go quietly into the night,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not make our Universe darker.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Live as Bright as The Sun.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Live as Wise, as the Greatest of Minds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when seen from a thousand years in the future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">May You Change The World.</div>
