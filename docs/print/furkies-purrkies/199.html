    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">We Must All Write</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Writing is like the spinning top in Inception,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a way to self evaluate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you continue being unable to write,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then it means you are surrounded by invisible walls.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Being able to lay down your favorite thoughts on a piece of paper,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and helping to inspire or enlighten someone, is a sign of health and inner-freedom, and in some cases Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are many styles of writing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and many directions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My style of writing is patterned after poems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I write two sentences per stanza, if I need a third sentence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then it generally means I over-complicated something.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think my favorite aim is to turn my little poems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">into little movies and stitch them together into a tiny documentary.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I've heard of a project called <span>Love Letters to Strangers<sup>[1]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I find that to be the sweetest aim of all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the larger scope,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must all write to update the surface for future generations to stand on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The books our parents read are great, by they are a bit old fashioned,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to, rebuild the library for the future generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We don't want the future to start with our parents,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we want them to start where we left off,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that we may spare them the aches we went through.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Things change.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When we talked about climate 50 years ago,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there was still a chance to become educated about it and make informed decisions, today.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, today, all we got is the observation that climate appears to have become more unstable,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and most are not educated enough to make any sense of it, or agree on any solution.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And that the world lost two-thirds of its wildlife is last 50 years,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">people are too desperate for food, money, housing and health, to grasp what that means.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need a new perspective on dealing with climate change,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because a world uneducated on the subject,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a world that will never reach a consensus, and may never do anything about it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Writing a book will tell you if you have the knowledge you think you do,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there are many teenagers, that feel they have mastered Quantum Physics; bless their Great Hearts and Beautiful Minds.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">However, they can only write an assay or two,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they can't synthesize new ideas to fill a book.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Feeling smart is a very healthy sign, that a person is headed in the right direction,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but writing a book is a sign that they have traveled a considerable way there, and are of great health.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can see what it means to be able to write a book much more clearly in this example in particular,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it means Freedom and Power of Mind, falling short is just... Dreaming.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a very powerful kind of book, that perhaps is most important,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and only a young person, during their youth can write it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Brilliant Teenage Minds that made some headway in life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">writing advice to their peers, that have unfortunately gotten stuck, or fallen.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Opening ones heart at a young age, is a very noble thing to do,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a sign of Great Beauty, Compassion and Grand Heroism.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Those books, must not be judged by adults,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">their creators must understand not to judge their creative writing by adult standards.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Adults are not what they seem, for one;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and second the people who benefit from those books are teenagers themselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A person who is suffering early in their life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is best helped by the words of someone who has recently managed to rise out of similar problems.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our youth is the most formative period of our life. Even the smallest of pains spared,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or littlest of mistakes avoided will have massive and profound influence over us, come our middle age.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Write,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">write when you are young,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">write when you are growing up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">write when nobody seems to be listening.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Write in the face of Liars,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">write in the face pretenders, fakers, manipulators, wannabes, and fake-it-until-you-make-it morons.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Write to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">write to become a beacon</div>
  <div class="paragraph">write to become a light of enlightenment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Write to bring back what has been written a generation before,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if the story is worth the while, retell it, retell it countless times.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And when you are ready to lay down your pencil for the day,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">read, read it out loud, and record it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because the light in your voice is worth a million books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And finally,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">know what it is all for...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is how the next generation learns from the previous one,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is how they win the wars we could only hoped to have won.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is how they become the heroes we hoped to be,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is how they save the world, that we can't see.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Write, because that's how you! become the hero you hoped to be,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and because the world belongs to the future generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not just you and me.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Write.</div>
