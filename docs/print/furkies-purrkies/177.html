    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning is one of the most important things we do, we need it for our health.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning helps us rise above our limits, and it sets us free from misperceptions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning requires that we progress in layers, that we build upon our existing knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We can only grow more knowledgeable when we build a comfortable little road of delicate achievements.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning requires happy curiosity, enjoyment, satisfaction, and distant horizons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The best kind of education is beautiful, colorful, enriching, and joyful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Calm, joy, happiness and Love of Life, is the is the secret of genius.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Happily sitting down beneath an apple tree, to review one's journals, and every once in a while hear an apple fall.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to be very careful to avoid toxic environments that push us into hoop jumping, or worse yet cause fractures and breed distrust towards education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In schools of today, we can only really memorize, jump the hoops and follow their rules. That's not Education, that's more like role play.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Education is too important to play games with.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Spending years pretending to get educated, is only going to earn your teacher money and grant you debt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will get older and poorer, and make your make-believe-teachers look more legitimate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just say no; choose Authenticity and Self Education, at your own happy pace with the books you love and teachers you admire.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learn on your own, listen to Audio Books and Lectures, choose happiness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning is sacred, choose adventure, choose genius.</div>
