    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just because the world is being tardy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it does not mean you should be too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In deed, if you fail to slowly make haste,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then the world will become darker for it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every Human must shine,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with Enlightenment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know it is hard to accept</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that schools may not be working.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We all have so little,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and now even more even rugs are pulled from beneath our feet.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is other stuff too,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">from bad parenting to mutually assured destruction.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am sorry, if you are looking for answers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the best answers any of them will ever give you is: "How were we supposed to know?"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A solid foundation in reality is a good start in life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">sometimes we don't figure things out until it is too late.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know this poem caught you early,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have a long time to ponder all this.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And that too is a good start,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a proper Gentlelady or Gentleman questions everything, and takes nothing for granted.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I hope you are still in Middle School or High School,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you get to walk to your desk, with a heavy step.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Slouch, perk up your ears like a Lion,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and take the whole situation apart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The kids in the back figured it out already,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but that is as far as they got, they need more answers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They need you!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the leader.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe you can try thinking about debates,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">learning from the way Great Beings argue the pretenders or the uneducated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are already given reasons,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">now you need to find the truth.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is never too early,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to begin to question everything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the smallest arguments we are given, is the argument for mathematics,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">well, it used to be given, it was that we aren't always going to have a calculator on hand.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Though it is cute to say that we have smart phones with calculators that have advanced mode,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is a darker side to it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mathematics is not enough,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we need Programming, and we need to be Shell Literate as well.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Vapid and Insipid Mathematics poisoned the beauty of Science,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">memorization of formulas obscured the simpler beauty beneath.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Memorization is another problem,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">look how carefully you are nudged to abandon reason and understanding in favor of memorization.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The guillotine of failing a class because you tried to learn everything,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">instead of passing with a straight A+ for merely cramming for the test - DOES chop your head off.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Look how proud your teacher is, that disingenuous show of teeth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">up for another raise, sold you for a paycheck and on some simple memes that you can get from a calendar.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the biggest reasons given to you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that you need a Diploma to get a Job.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I would like you to consider, that perhaps a real diploma,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is one that a University goes out of their way to give; you for your Great Achievements.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The diploma you receive at the end of your stay in school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">while it grants you access to higher institutions and more advanced jobs...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">...it will not prevent those jobs from endangering or sacrificing you for profit,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the best lies are the ones that others maneuver you into believing, choices you would never make without their poison.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your life, does not compare to other lives, no matter how precious or numerous,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is no Life Arithmetic.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The closest you can get to a formula is this wonderful contradiction:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each life is more important than the other.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If someone ever asks you to do something for the greater good, you are not sacrifice,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you quit your job or await your dishonorable discharge, and begin your search for Enlightenment and Wisdom, onward to becoming a Great Being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If the best job you can possibly get, holds some measure of risk,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then you are going to need to try harder.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In case you are wondering,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">- I care, and you can't undo that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The harder, or the less worn path,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that of becoming an Independent Inventor and Entrepreneur.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And you are not going to be the first or only one,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">find the others, find a couple of co-founders, learn from your Noble Failures as well as Triumphant Successes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So when someone says "Diploma",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you reply; "Check Your Premise", to quote an old friend.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When they say calculator,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you say: "Help me with programming not memorizing formulas."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When they box you in to memorize,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you get the others to drop the class, because you need a real education, one that helps you to wisdom and greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While governments are smart enough to encourage learning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as evidenced by mandatory education, they are not smart enough to tell a real education from a fake one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I suspect the intelligence of governments is dictated purely by the voters,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in that wise people will not vote in uneducated representatives.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But you see the small catch-22 or egg and chicken problem,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a government can't easily become intelligent enough to encourage real education, without majority of voters being educated for real.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way to do boot the process and hopefully sustain it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to mirror the educational paths of pioneers and founders, in a short: Self Education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Self education is not that outrageous,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is what real schools are supposed to encourage you to do, without any interference.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And let me underline that interference will destroy self education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">grades, cookie cutter curricula, the threat of repeating classes or even semesters can destroy a beautiful and delicate mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Self education is like learning to walk, except this time you learn to move in the Universe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and instead of getting your feet to move quite right, you are trying to find the audio books that somewhat fit what you already know.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally on a related subject, it hurts me to say it, but "Free College" is not quite right,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it should be "Free Real and Effective Education that Shows Real Results"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Compare that to the an Important Vaccine, we don't need a mere Free Shot of Something spelled out with weasel words,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we need a real and effective vaccine that shows real results across millions of participants.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You should not allow yourself to think of College or University as something that gets you a good job,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a good job is nothing, the dumbest of liars can get you fired if you get in their way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The thing you must look for is Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as that opens all the gateways ahead of you; but more importantly that path is most worthy of you, it is the most human and healthiest of paths.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All you need to start is a small bowl of ice cream, an electric blanket, a fine pillow, a comfy bed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and a narrated book by Carl Sagan, or Neil deGrasse Tyson, or Bill Bryson.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then as you get going, and maybe take to liking new titles from best-seller lists and new authors you have never heard of,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">find a a small, perhaps, pocket sized, well respected book on Bush Craft, and start getting ready for your first tiny venture into the Wild by buying a backpack and a tent...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will need a pair of cut proof gloves, a 16" Bowie knife (don't do 14"), get high quality Damascus, Stag Horn Handle, fine leather sheath, full tang, obviously...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and a second actually useful Bush Craft Knife, and then splurge on a sharp fordable hand saw you can bring along to all adventures, and get an audio book, and fire going as everyone else is still hacking away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As you read more and more,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and things start making sense, as you slowly and independently begin forming an accurate view of the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Bring a cheerful friend, or your mum, to a near by state park,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one with a fine beach and a tidy nick-knack store that also doubles as a hot dog stand and perhaps serves a fine and spicy vegetarian alternative.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Later on, grab couple of lovely and trusting friends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">fool enough to try to through-hike the Applachin Trail with you in one go from Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Though I highly recommend section hiking at first,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and also, please, please, visit Henry at Walden Pond each time you climb Katahdin.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You know, it is hard to miss the fact that a tent in bear country makes for a fine dorm room,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that each white blaze you meet on the AT, doubles as an A+ that no teacher could possibly give you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And that each time you make it up Katahdin with a hundred new books on your mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you do graduate ever higher.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think both Henry and the Mountain grant you some of their height</div>
  <div class="paragraph">- I know for certain without a doubt; and I know you can feel it too: You are meant to become a Great Being.</div>
