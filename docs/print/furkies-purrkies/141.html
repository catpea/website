    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">In The Eyes Of The Future Generations</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are not Island Universes scattered to no end in some void,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are a part of a growing civilization with a past and a future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we might have become confused about the Scope of Our Existence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we stand divided by borders and committed to repeating history's mistakes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is unwise to pretend to be able to handle a great responsibility,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">only desperation, fractures, and exploitation by other desperate pretenders can follow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Those who are granted authority are often not wise enough to handle it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and in their mediocrity they commit what in larger scope translates to real Crimes Against Humanity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There cannot be wisdom without understanding and inheriting from past generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the transfer of knowledge occurs by means of Understanding Books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And there cannot be understanding without Authenticity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in haste of chasing a career there can only be memorization and misunderstanding.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must keep in mind; that what the future generations do not perceive as clear progress,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will be seen as the continuation of dark ages with authorities on the wrong side of history.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The World United, is not a fairy-tale, nor should it be a mere dream for us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but a Gift of Peace for The Future Generations, so that they may grow in Dignity, Health, and Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are neither disconnected from the future generations, nor the past generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are a stepping stone in the development of The Human Kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we should recognize this Great Honor and Reward,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and understand that the larger context is found in helping to build a better world for future generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All our decisions, across all levels and authorities,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Police, Attorneys and Judges, Parents, Teachers and Principals, Mayors, Governors, Prime Misters and Presidents, and everybody else...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Must be mindful of future generations, of a growing world, of making lasting and meaningful contributions to the entire human kind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a World that will eventually become united and free of borders.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A world with future generations that will look back at us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">right now, right here, with questions that we must present answers to.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are getting stuck in circles,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because people are forgetting history's lessons.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because we are not thinking on a large enough scale,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we end up building more prisons rather than ending poverty with meaningful prevention programs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Endless cycles of heartless poverty that freeze the best of us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">poverty that wouldn't even be a feature of modern society had we in our wisdom recognized it for what it is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty denies people food and well being,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">causes stress and great harm to mind and body.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Love above Law, before we allow the practice of law,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must end the cycles of poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Money must not be used to limit people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is meant to help.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And how can a culture be to fail to see, how a young person allowed to build a business without the threat of homelessness and starvation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will contribute back to the city and everyone's well being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What is so hard about seeing that rather than sending non-violent criminals to prison,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we can prevent their biggest mistakes by putting an end to their worries of sleeping hungry on the street.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Any time, we fail to keep to reality,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">be it sending a 15 year old lady to prison, or denying science, or tolerating arrests by obscured or unidentified agencies, or abuses of power or discretion.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We create fractures and distrust,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">blindly defacing and destroying work of many much wiser great beings, who gave their best trusting that we can carry on, in wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must not move against the grain of reality,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">any and all divergence will only create a cascade of fractures that will demand constant attention</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and result in nothing more than systems that merely stand to support themselves and as an affront to justice and future generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Where there was once a solution as clear as helping children to inherit the wisdom of their elders,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we now see the emergence of a failed and impotent educational system with a mass incarceration backed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom and inheritance of knowledge cannot be replaced by a "fake it until you make it" trickery,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the work of great beings must not be stained by people who fail to see their vision.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once again, the world grows a generation at a time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the education of the teenagers from 20 years ago is currently influencing the state of the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Likewise, how we treat out children today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will have a monumental impact on the world 20 years from now.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us honor our children and all the future generations by encouraging them to books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by reminding them of the Great Power of Thinking Beings, of Philosophers and Lovers of Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By reminding them that their Pursuit of Excellence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">can only make the world a better place for us all, and even those that are yet to come.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us remind them that Books (and now Audio Books) serve as a wonderful source of our wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">especially when read in a sequence that fits them best, and understood at thier own pace.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us remind each other that we must reject short thinking and shortest paths,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that do not help the world grow and keep us divided.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us break out of that selfish endless loop of repeating mistakes of past generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by working towards a better world a more united world where we recognize each other as One Family.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And let us remember that the great and wise beings of past generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">demand that we honor hard won triumphs and do not repeat history's mistakes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The very nature of that demand requires that once we take to wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must stop following orders, and begin thinking, evaluating, and judging for ourselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To honor triumphs and guard against heartbreaking mistakes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is the duty we hold to those who came before us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and all the future generations that are yet to follow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As children we are asked to listen and follow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as we grow we must learn to Lead and become Unbreakable.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not just the challenges of life that will test us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must also think and evaluate and reject that which is wrong.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are constantly made to listen and expected to follow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">look behind any protest, or scandal, or angry headline.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must judge all the contradictory information for ourselves,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and make an informed decision as to whether or not majority is correct.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Life will always challenge us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and My Goodness - times are always changing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity is constantly bettering her self,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what used to be acceptable - may now, be an affront to justice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And while there isn't enough time to comprehend all the books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is plenty of time to be come a Loving and Wise Compassionate Human Being,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us remember that we are a chain-link between the Hard Work of Past Generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the United, Free from Poverty, and Peaceful Word of <strong>Future</strong> Generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are One Growing Family, and that is the correct context for local, state, and federal levels, for all legal and administrative decision making,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to diverge from this reality is to get stuck in an endless loop of repeating history's mistakes, the very thing that the past generations are asking us not to do.</div>
