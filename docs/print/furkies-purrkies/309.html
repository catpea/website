      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Do Not Take Things For Granted, And Reject The Status Quo</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Existentialists say that we must give our existence a meaning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are not to accept what we are told to become.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Evolutionary biologists say there was once a need to listen to the elders,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it helped tribe cohesion, it got the younger ones on fast track.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Atheists say that we are not to mistake myth for reality,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no matter how comfortable it makes us feel.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Scientists teach us to question everything, reproduce previous results,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to be skeptical and free of biases, and never put opinion over fact.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools are actively trying to convince us that memorization is superior,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to looking something up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At work we get less for more,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">until we are replaced with a younger employee that costs them a fraction.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And everywhere we are bombarded with falsehoods, broken promises, half-truths,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and things that are too good to be true.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All of this added together begs that we take control of our life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is safer to think for ourselves, than to have somebody else think for us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us stop following advice,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">unless we know for certain that it is wise advice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When we are told to become a Doctor or a Lawyer,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">let us turn the table around and reply:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"No, that's what you want,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that's what you should do."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And let us begin building ourselves from ground up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with all the wisdom that we can find - from libraries; to great little adventures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are too many people that stand to get something out of you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you listen to them, and do what they want.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to do what you want, and the best way to figure out what that is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is by inheriting many lifetimes of knowledge from fascinating books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are too complex to follow a single thing that someone tell you to follow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you need to stitch your body wisdom out of hundreds of wise books and build your own way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Take good care of your mind and body, and be mindful of the fact that as you become wiser,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">your horizons will broaden, and what you once thought impossible will become easy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The wiser you become the more open gateways will appear before you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">think by subtle analogy to your childhood, how small your world was back then, and how big it is now.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With more wisdom your world will become even bigger,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so please don't worry that you are stuck.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are not stuck, so as long as you read and learn from wise books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the wisdom you need is well on its way to enlighten you and your path.</div>
