      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">To Venus And Back: A Fanciful Flight Of Fancy</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <small>(The following presentation is an experimental writing exercise based on a daydream I once had, so better grab onto your butts.)</small>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody cared about the old <span>Bulletin Board Systems<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and not all the people cared about <span>Zak McKracken<sup>[2]</sup></span>, or later on <span>Wolfenstein 3D<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The old computer dreams are good dreams,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">finely crafted expert systems for one were clearly going to change the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">An expert system does basic logic,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but a finely made one, can actually help us reason about complex issues.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The AI we know today is drenched in chaos,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is just statistics done right.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The expert systems, are, tools for us, based on our needs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a way of encoding legal systems.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Mechanical Turk, or as I call it The Ghost In The Machine,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are a way for all human beings on earth to make money.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>MUD<sup>[4]</sup></span>, is actually the tool we need to create intelligence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it will still rely on statistics, but not blindly.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It would take a life time for one person to craft a world</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where dreams and observations, would combine to create sanity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Like with all computer programs, garbage in garbage out,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the virtual world to fuel the real AI, must be finely crafted by a human mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our minds are crafted by a different processes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one that involves a lot of accidents.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And cherry on top,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are here because accidents come together just right and emerge a civilization,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that can ask "why are we here?", and we are proof of that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to make use of computers the right way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we need legal systems that rely on expert systems.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Simulations will likely reveal,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that there is certain limit to how many laws are too many and ruin a system.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Simulations will also reveal that we can't fix cities,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by sentencing people to poverty and fracturing them into a desperate life of crime.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I say, "We are all very smart", I mean it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but we also need a real education, a fake education can only add to poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A city that continues fracturing minds with poverty and fake education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then sending them to prisons, and making it so that they can't get a job afterwards...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Is not a city yet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is still just a hope of one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Universal Basic Income,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a good transition idea.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But then businesses specifically crafted,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for taking that money will emerge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We see a model that they can potentially adopt with student debt,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">unforgivable debt, no bankruptcy is big enough to wipe it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We'll just see businesses offering more free money,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to take a cut of that free income.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we can't possibly exclude anybody,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not in prison, not in hospital.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now that people with debt are going to be receiving free money,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">those checks will be intercepted by debt collection agencies, which as you can imagine are going to spring to life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And Universal doesn't mean national,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it means world wide.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">After all,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we need not create anymore inequality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have seen the emergence of special debt,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the unforgivable student debt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now we will need to see the emergence of a new kind of money,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one that can only be spent by the owner, on what the owner wishes, not what she is forced to spend on...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But what she chooses to spend it on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is far beyond the thinking of any congress.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But it is trivial for a computer system to process another kind of currency,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I say we give it a name right now, before someone beat us to it, let us call it Love, with the symbol of a Red Heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And might as well create a new country for it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the country should be called Love as well, and it should be a tiny little thing, maybe a square meter at first.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It will have a bank on paper,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that bank will be very wealthy, for Humanity will have to agree to give it the possession of one of more of the larger planets in the Suns orbit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is to satisfy the bankers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I say, lets give Love the Planet Venus, and <span>The Oort Cloud<sup>[5]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that should be a pretty penny, and might as well give Venus, Jupiter, as gassy as he is I think they are a good match.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Come to think of it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">why don't we avoid the whole argument of where the Love Nation should be place on earth, and simply establish it, in the orbit of Venus.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now we have a currency that cannot be used to pay of debt,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but can be used to buy a home, and food, and medicine.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You may laugh,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but Humanity has to grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What we have right now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is just a stepping stone.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is meant to be used once,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">on our way to the next step.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When we are children,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are not defined by borders.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We don't care about dumb ideas,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">like color of skin, name of some imaginary creature, concentration camps, or war.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We should not allow ourselves to get dumber as we grow older,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and instead take what wisdom we have as children, and amplify it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It seems sometimes, that the world would be a much nicer place,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if it was ran by the kids in the world's kindergarten's with some good advice from their loving mums and teachers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Weapons of war, would be forbidden,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">borders would be erased every one of them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And let me tell you something,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which currency would do think they would pick as the main one, you bet they would!</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But rather than bothering clearly WISE-er people who are otherwise still growing up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">lets just use computers instead.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every bank terminal would now require a new filed, Planet Name,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Bank Of Love, Milky Way Road 1, Planet Venus.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think overtime, as it gre in power,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it would create some principles that must not be violated by Earth's Nations that now rely on it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it would get tough,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">saying no to Weapons of War is easy, but this bank would also say no to Prisons, cages, or as I call it Slavery under the protection of the 13th amendment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Slowly,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">these clear ideas, would realign Humanity with reality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know many will disagree wit these ideas,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but these ideas are not for them, their disagreement means that they are not allowed to use that Lovely Credit Card themselves, they can disagree all they want.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They will just sit in their expensive retirement homes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">yelling at clouds, and it is their own wish, no backsies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Children deserve a real education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and a kind of money for home, food medicine, hospital, and many other necessities that make Earth look better, in Venus' eyes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us not dismiss this day dream,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">instead let us make it real.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When we are brought up correctly,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">without abusive indoctrination, we are just one family.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whoever out there is shooting across some border,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are only doing so because how they were brought up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is only one way to be brought up on earth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with Knowledge, with Wisdom, and encouragement towards becoming Great Beings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and honoring every other human being on earth with a lasting contribution, even if it is a silly day dream that is hard to forget.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Remember, the people who ridicule stories like this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are only doing that, because they were brought up into a in invisible prison, a prison whose walls they cannot see.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They will do horrible things to stay in their prisons,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to wait them out, and help the children understand that all the horrible things they see are horrible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can explain that this is how humanity transitions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">from the old to the new, there are these wretched middle steps as we wait for dictatorships to crumble.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I asked my grand ma to explain what they were doing on TV,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">she said it was war.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And when I asked why, she said,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Because, that is what men do."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us change that answer from now on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and instead let it become:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"We are in a state of transition and in search for great and powerful dreams, as we wait for evil men to age and pass away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And children like you to be brought up in Knowledge, Wisdom, and in Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See, we cannot fight the bullies back,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because then we would become bullies too, and that cycle must be broken.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So we bring up out children towards Greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">while we wait for the broken men to become faded and pass.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you grow up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">time will come for you to become a leader.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But unlike the old,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the new will aim towards Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Unlike the old,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the new will take the greatest possible steps, not the smallest.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And when it all becomes too complicated,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">always remember, computers are the tools of the future, and they will make everything easier for you."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I will close my story here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we invented new currency, we built a beautiful nation on Venus, and we changed the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if it all seems too much,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you should remember Dear Reader, that we are already testing interplanetary Ships, the next step may not be that far off, as far as generations go.</div>
