      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Don&#39;t Let Anybody Push You Around</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know this sounds like basic advice,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but this is tough.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">School was double trouble for me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not only was it nonsense, but it also came with bullies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was dangerous, so I stopped going,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it never occurred to me to call the police.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I thought everyone was getting bullied,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't even complain to the school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't complain about my bad grades in programming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the teacher marked me down because he got angry that I was copying.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It never occurred to me to go to the principal,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the bullies were already laughing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was this short kid getting beaten up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I tried to push away his bully.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Who was an A student,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and an addict.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not only did the two turn on me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but my main bully joined in two.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I don't fight,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because that would only make me a bully.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, when I am in danger,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">everyone is going to be pushed away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The fight came to an abrupt end,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as my bully was already hurt, probably from his father.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">SO the teachers got around,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for the first time in five years bullying was noticed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Except that when I got back to my classroom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the smartest of the girls, told me that they don't want me there anymore.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just about at the same moment,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the school shrink came in, put her hand on my shoulder and said everything is OK.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The two that originally started the fight,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">begun lying that I started the fight.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I told the psychologist to grill them until they start telling the truth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and she finally got the real story out of them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And they got punished,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't do anything wrong other than pushing my bullies away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Each of them, including the little one tried to fight me before,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I still didn't want the little guy to get beaten up, I know what it is like.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Few days later, my main bully, invited college kids to teach me a lesson,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they actually came into to the school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I did not see the kick,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">he must have been standing behind me.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't really get hurt,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but I stayed on the ground to be safe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Russian language teacher saw me down,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and didn't do anything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I made it to class,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the bully that invited the older boys to teach me a lesson, was laughing at me.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think the side of my face was red from the kick,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they would have been arrested if I knew to call the police.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am certain they had knives,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there were four to six of them, they had look outs by the stairs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My main bully was lying that I was beating him up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was either because his father was abusing him.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Or because his father was teaching him to shit on other people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">he was telling his kid how to destroy me.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Since I assumed this always happens to everyone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was fine, a little lonely.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">After the big bullies came,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was dangerous to go back to school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So I went the other way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">wisely.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I saw my main bully watching me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">waiting for the buss that goes the other way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They were jealous, they laughed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who knows.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Th first time I crossed the street to wait for the bus that goes the other way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">meant I dropped out of school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My parents were already angry for me pushing bullies away,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">after five years of taking their punches, but I didn't care.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was not a victim,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was a warrior.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I won every one of those fights,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by not hurting them back.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Each time they came to attack me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I became stronger, nobler, more powerful, smarter, more independent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Isolation didn't hurt me either,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all I ever knew was bullying, and being alone, I used to enjoy it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I had a Commodore 64, and I used Simon's Basic to teach myself about pixels,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I never liked playing computer games, I still don't.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, I kept current, with every major game release,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I carefully paid attention, to the pixels.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Souls games<sup>[1]</sup></span> are my favorite, of course,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">never payed them but they are each a masterpiece.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That where the buss took me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it took me into the world of Pixel Art.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was an old underground World War 2 bunker,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that was filled with Arcade Games.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If I didn't go back to school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>I would have been coding my own intros, I would have become part of the demo scene<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I would have mastered it all,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but I went back, but it took the teachers four months to catch on that I was gone.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Four amazing months,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I never had the money to play games, I would only watch others play it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My favorites were <span>Asterix<sup>[3]</sup></span> and <span>The Simpsons<sup>[4]</sup></span> by Konami,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and <span>Street Fighter II<sup>[5]</sup></span> by Capcom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I also enjoyed <span>Wonder Boy<sup>[6]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I just think it is really neat.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even after I graduated that strange place,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and went to a much nicer school bullies were there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The older they get the creeper they become,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one kid actually freaked out, as I didn't pull my hand away, I bet he still remembers that smell.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The biggest bully there, that seemed like a normal person,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">was actually a neo nazi, I wasn't scared but I kept my distance.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was time to pack by that time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I ended up in Brooklyn, NY.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And again, as I was waking back from school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the local boxer kid, started punching me in the back of my head.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Brooklyn was my home though,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I called the police, I told them I would not press charges.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While they said they couldn't do anything,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they were all gone.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Before I moved to the state I am in now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the bully walked by me and using the F word explained that he does not like Poles, as in polish people.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was too scared to say anything,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but most of the polish people I knew were very cruel to me.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I always tried to make friends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but, it was difficult.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The part of me that made me win every fight without fighting,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by being strong, and dignified.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Is not comfortable around people that do alcohol, drugs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that go to bars, and live in that creepy culture of get plastered, get stoned, get laid, get wasted, lie, cheat, and steal.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I became strong, not by running away from fights,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but by not punching back, by taking the hardest path, and the easy roads are just not for me, they are frightening.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I tried to help many people in my journeys,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but help must come from within.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One time I mumbled something about helping people a decade back, at a Chinese restaurant near by,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and a lady almost yelled at me "That is not your problem, not your responsibility."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I admitted to her "I know that now.",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but before I thought we had to help each other.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I never really helped anyone get out of any trouble,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think it was because I didn't look like a wise old man.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody was listening to me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but I tried!</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My big advice, is to remember the Dean, the principal, the police,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">don't let anybody push you around.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you get an unfair grade,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">don't just stand there like I did - go to the principal, and make yourself at home.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are too scared to speak, say so,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I have trouble speaking because I am scared, please give me a moment to gather my thoughts."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If bullies come after you, you have to call the police, to help them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the police needs to investigate their parents.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No child is born a bully, the worst of them are victims of abuse, if you get the police on it early,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then you maybe able to save your bullie's mind from permanent damage, where they stay a bully for life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My last piece of advice is tough,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you drop out, that is life telling you that you don't belong there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See, I went back to school because I was scared of becoming homeless,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but poverty is an error, it is not meant to be your driving force.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty is a mistake that Humanity didn't know it made,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">poverty is not your fault.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to fight the errors,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have to challenge poverty with knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not spend your life time running away from it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or towards some stick and carrot promotion.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If the schools fail you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then you go to the library.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Audio Books started flourishing just about ten years ago,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is the first time in Human history that we can really get into books, without any effort.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't drop out completely,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for one the kids in the back row need to understand that they are not stupid, they are just too mature to memorize garbage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Call out the teachers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the curriculum, write to the local newspaper.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>The Deans and Principals know that schools are bullshit<sup>[7]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">at the very least they owe you lunch.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you just rise above the nonsense,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the constant memorization of noise, the overwhelming mediocrity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your mind will grow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">flourish.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Get your mittens on all the books about education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">mass incarceration, politics and corporate fraud, and try to figure out how everything works.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If your Biology teacher proclaims "Weed to be an herb.", like mine did,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">don't just drop out like I did.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Get up, and say "Let's see what your employer has to say about that",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">go to the Principles office, and face the wrath that will come from it all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learn to stand up for what is right,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because this is your world, by the time you are their age they will have long retired, and will care even less.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>The world needs Heroes<sup>[8]</sup></span>, those who stand up for truth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and learn to find entertainment in rage and anger that is causes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't let years of bulling hurt me at all,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I became stronger and wiser for it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If misfortune finds you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">rise up, back away, and forge your own path in life, aim away from mediocrity, and the easier wrong.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Misfortune, especially one that you can't help, is good training,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it will make you a ridiculously overpowered warrior, and a ridiculously cheerful one too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Besides, the moment you rise above your troubles,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you come into the company of all the great warriors an thinkers, prophets and philosophers, dreamers and artists that came before you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can't allow yourself to be stressed out by broken schools and equally broken bullies,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or anything that is broken, that is not mean to drive you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is your life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you are meant to bloom towards greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You must not hide or run away from broken things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are all meant to become great beings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if you become lonely, use that to your advantage too, <span>take to the trails<sup>[9]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and remember what Henry said.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms..."</div>
