    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know all too well that writing books is hard,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as far as I can tell; I am still learning English.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But books, share principles, with life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">be it book or life, it is always page after page, it has chapters.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Books are not, some fancy extra,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but a pretty fancy way of rising, just rising.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And perhaps it is somewhat old fashioned to be urging you to write books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but I don't feel bad at all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I expect the first one is the hardest,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the second one will be shoooo goood,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The third one - I am sorry,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will feel as floppy as a thinly sliced ham.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The fourth one,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">after that long wonderful pause.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Will surely be the one,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it will feel like such a closure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But listen,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I suspect that we don't really get started until our fifth book.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">'Cause you know,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is the book you don't think about writing that gets you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And, I think I can actually predict enough of it to say,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that as children we look to the future, as adults we grow, and as Great Beings we look at the past with wise eyes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See, it is not until we get there, and glance over at ideas that we were passionate about when young,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but now through the eyes of the Great Being... that all of a sudden, things like Amor Fati, are not merely about Love of Fate,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But also, from when we look at life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">see when looking back we see fate as something that that largely already unfolded.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And now, the love for it fits,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is the love for all we've been through.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All the battles we fought and learned from regardless it it was triumph or disaster, ease or hardship,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was what we grew <strong>so profound</strong>, what made us, ourselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So as long, as we fought to rise,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so as long as it counts for more than whim and being pushed around.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It doesn't matter how hard things were,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it matters that nothing took away from our Love of Life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That we faced those challenges,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">easy or difficult.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you sit at the typewriter, and you know the story dot for dot.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See, we have to live our life so sturdily,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as to bring enlightenment to our Elder Selves, and perhaps make them cry a little - and why the heck not!</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See, growing is not just for getting somewhere,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but also building what will eventually become our Beautiful Past.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And though as children we may need to admit to ourselves that we don't understand everything,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as Great Beings come Our Golden Age, we will understand what we once struggled with.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And with a great sense of accomplishment,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a sense of accomplishment that wouldn't be there, had we not challenged ourselves with things that were out of our grasp when we were young.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So what may seem as difficulty in our youth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we will end up loving in our Golden Age for making us stronger and more profound.</div>
