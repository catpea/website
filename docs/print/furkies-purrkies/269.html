    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom has many names and can be viewed in many different ways,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">most popular perspective is that [non-academic] Philosophy leads to wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One particularly beautiful view,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">hints on wisdom with the words Content of Character.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The most mechanically sound description is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">understanding new things by subtle analogy to what we already know.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The most concerning view states that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">without wisdom we will be making mistakes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think most reasonable view; is all of the above,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">plus knowledge gained from Adventure, Philosophy, and Science Books and Audio Books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What is it for?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Why, it is our Operating System.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">PART II, Thought Experiment</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Allow me to share with you a thought experiment,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a way of seeing things that aid in your view of the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without wisdom, we form tribes and elect leaders, shamans, or popes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and hire muscle, creatures of violence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because that is the same thing the other tribe is doing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the weaker one will be destroyed with great horror.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These tribal bare bone behavior did not end in middle ages,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as one would hope.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This behavior is the default human behavior for the frightened and uneducated,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the desperate, the angry, even the sick.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We may not understand why criminals do the things they do,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but we can imagine one of our family members, who one by one loses everything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And on the last day, when all he has left,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is an ounce of sanity, and a beating hart, he will fight, steal, and hate just to live another day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And for those who can't imagine why one would like to live another day when it is all pain,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to persevere memories, to keep the fallen alive.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And here we meet a Man of Honor,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a Judge, along with a jury, and wealthy lawyers in fantastic shoes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And all they see is a mad man,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a criminal, a man who needs to be put in a cage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Judge is wrong,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when it comes to putting people in cages, all judges are wrong.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To restore this man, he needs a home, and books, and friends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and an education, and hope, and reams, and free money, and free food.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He needs to be treated with love and dignity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and granted an opportunity to persevere his memories in a book.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are no criminals,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are just broken children.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The ugliness of the worst of them is just an act,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they just want to be left alone.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And I suppose that evil men do exist,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but I don't think there is enough of them in the world to fill a single prison.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The 10,000,000 people we keep in cages,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are just children with severe developmental issues.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are no political systems advanced enough to treat these beings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">their only hope is the Public Defender.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Public Defenders will fight to keep the broken people out of prison,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because they know prison will only make them worse.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you ever wanted to see a real Angel,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">ask a Judge to let you sit in on a court case, look that tired being in the eyes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are Human Beings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are not animals to be kept in cages.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I have met snarling beasts,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I saw their red faces and bulging eyes, and they were just broken kids.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At first I wanted my older self to come and help me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but later I just started calling them My Bullies, they never had a chance at a good life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And here we find a sliver of sanity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because there is something that can be done to control crime.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is preventing children from being forced into that desperate mode of existence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">PREVENTION.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Prevention is a simple thing, Free Home, Free Food, Free Money,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Free Tutors, a Real Education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It will take a psychologist to identify those who need help,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is as simple as that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No suffering,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no harm.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And for those of you who are crazy enough to ask who will pay for this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">let us call the institution a Bank of Love, right at the Heart of a Country.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They print only as much money as people need to be taken care of,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they pride themselves in the amount of debt that nobody will come to collect.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Prevention, is really about education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because an educated person can make a lot more than any government can grant them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Social Programs, Real Welfare, or Universal Basic Income,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will grant a person a Home, a Car, Food, and all the necessities, but they can't pay for extras.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They'll pay for an education leading up to a Captains License,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but not the boat.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Prevention will go a long way to bring the number of prisoners down,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">these desperate beings are part of our family, it is all of us or none.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are a young civilization,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we don't have governments that can handle Universal Basic Income.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have governments,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that can barely handle themselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can cross this bridge, the bridge where we eliminate poverty, and homelessness, and immense fear and suffering,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">suffering that draws those who have the courage to keep fighting into addiction so that they don't burst out of pain.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To get there, to begin growing up as a civilization,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">those of us who can handle it must take to Books and Audio Books and reach Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Only in your Wisdom can the world begin growing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">beyond the noisy mess that desperate, blind and tone deaf career politicians created.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The youngest of you are going to inherit all these problems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but you will also know that all of these problems are happening due to lack of wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Treat the cause,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the symptoms will subside.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Only in wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">can our civilization advance forward.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Personal Note,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Those of you who are just learning about the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">know that it is confusing because hardly anything works right.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Be it a be it a Judge, or General, and most shockingly a Jury,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are missing lessons that help them see the world as a Work in Progress.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are still building the foundation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we are getting too much interference from our leadership.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Look no further than the complete loss of privacy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is a function of uneducation and desperation, and blindness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Enhanced interrogation, is even a more terrifying example,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the world has no faith in nations that practice torture.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The 13th Amendment to Constitution of United States did not end Slavery in Full</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it reads "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have a lot of work on your hands,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you will have a lot of friends working just as hard as you, and all over the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While you are still young, take to Adventure Audio Books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">read them all, and especially pay attention to the part where the adventurer reveals the reason for this quest.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In less than a Hundred Audio Books that call to you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will begin becoming wise onward to becoming a great being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is in it self a great adventure,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and if I may, a Memoir is best written as your life unfolds, it is never too early to start writing.</div>
