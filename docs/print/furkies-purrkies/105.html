  <p>My Friends,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Your youth holds a great power,</p>
  <p>a power that you can hold on to throughout your entire existence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is the power of creating a life that you will love,</p>
  <p>a life that will help you see with great clarity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A Life of Wisdom.</p>

  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But you must be careful,</p>
  <p>as the world may not yet be ready to help you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Not everyone will know about growing up,</p>
  <p>and people will say: &quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And they are not going to be the bad guys,</p>
  <p>and you will be inclined to listen to their advice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And the path will be paved with good intentions,</p>
  <p>it maybe the correct path, but it won&apos;t be the right one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Please, focus on building your own self,</p>
  <p>your strength, your wisdom, your power.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Focus on building the best you,</p>
  <p>the you that you are meant to be, that the world needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because if you listen to everybody else,</p>
  <p>you will not grow up, and they will blame you for not being able to help them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You are not going to be able to explain to them,</p>
  <p>that you are weak because of them,</p>
  <p>because you tried to help them too early.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And if you could, all they could say will be:</p>
  <p>&quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Please, you have no choice,</p>
  <p>but to learn to control your own future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You can try to use your imagination,</p>
  <p>to get in touch with your Elder Self;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And ask &quot;What are your regrets?&quot;,</p>
  <p>&quot;Where did it go wrong?&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Please, carefully evaluate your choices,</p>
  <p>wisely build your Mind and Body.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Pay attention to all the choices you are making,</p>
  <p>as they dictate the Beautiful Life Ahead of You.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The teachers are not ready, we are not in the Era of Wisdom yet,</p>
  <p>people are struggling to understand life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Many make choices that all too early box them in,</p>
  <p>and not all their advice will apply to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Not all the things that you think box people in,</p>
  <p>actually constrain them, there are many contexts to all the paths.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All lives are beautiful, and there are enough forks in the road,</p>
  <p>for people to navigate back to where they want to be.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But, when a mistake occurs, it will weigh you down for a time,</p>
  <p>if you are careful, you can avoid the worst of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And whatever does happen, regardless of how hard you tried to avoid it,</p>
  <p>will not crush you, because you will know you did your best.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Please, be careful in life, be beautiful, and strong,</p>
  <p>learn, and think, and evaluate, and judge, and grow in wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Following everyone&apos;s advice, will create a lot of noise,</p>
  <p>listening to everything from everywhere will never align with you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You must lean to pace yourself,</p>
  <p>and to carefully and wisely follow what interests you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Your mind is constantly asking questions,</p>
  <p>your future depends on having a good intuition, rooted in reality, and in wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There is nothing you can be force-taught school,</p>
  <p>you will not retain things that are out of sequence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Reaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom in your own sequence, and at your own pace,</p>
  <p>is the only way to learn, and build steps, and build on top of those steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>No one can decide what lesson you are ready for next,</p>
  <p>that is something that comes from the complexity of your own mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Those people who are doing well in school without cramming and memorization,</p>
  <p>have previously arrived at those subjects in their own sequence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The same applies to your job, your career,</p>
  <p>your career needs to emerge from the path you were growing up with.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It needs to be an an extension of your pursuits,</p>
  <p>it must benefit you, and help you grow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Just like you must actually learn, instead of just getting grades,</p>
  <p>your work must add to you, and not, rob you of your years.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Do you understand the value of a Single Year of Your Precious Life?</p>
  <p>no one can put a price on that, not even you, there are not enough atoms in the Universe.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That is why Harmony with Education, and Work is so important,</p>
  <p>each year must be lived on the path that makes you grow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I am so sorry, that people will tell you to cram for tests,</p>
  <p>and get a job, and get on with life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I am so sorry, My Friends,</p>
  <p>but that is the worst, you can do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That&apos;s why you can&apos;t listen to anyone,</p>
  <p>that&apos;s why you have to look into yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Carefully evaluate all decisions,</p>
  <p>whilst carefully evaluating consequences, and being mindful of your future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You are not alone, look to Memoirs, look to Biographies,</p>
  <p>listen to Audiobooks, Explore, and Create.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And you must take care of your body,</p>
  <p>the best you can, at first.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And with each year,</p>
  <p>you will gain more, and add a bit more as you grow in Health and Fortitude.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Your Elder Self needs to be Flexible, and Healthy,</p>
  <p>you may never grunt and complain, that&apos;s something you have to be mindful of now.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is not just about making choices for your Future,</p>
  <p>but also for your body too.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Do you see how going along with cramming for tests,</p>
  <p>can put you in a field where your job makes life more stressful,</p>
  <p>which will prevent you from taking good care of your body?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Imagine the consequences of walking a path that is not truly your own,</p>
  <p>and what will your Elder Self feel when you two finally become, One?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Be gentle with yourself,</p>
  <p>this is Your Life, Your Beautiful-Beautiful Life.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Stop trying to find a job or get hired, and become the kind of a person;</p>
  <p>that companies can only hope to hire.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Start living healthy, years before you start your training,</p>

  <p>Chose Audio-books that really help your wisdom grow,</p>

  <p>If you can&apos;t find a career path that will add onto you,</p>
  <p>then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4JtyLKDjXk">start your own company</a>,</p>
