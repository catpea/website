  <div class="paragraph">A Thousand Books is not just about becoming wise,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is also about becoming unstuck from whatever indoctrinations captured us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the terrifying aspects of indoctrination is that you can't see it at first,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and society at large is not yet mature enough to separate indoctrination from personality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are many people who were sent to prisons,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not because of who they really are, but because they were decision-making in some creepy world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I once met an otherwise nice older person,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who turned out to hate immigrants.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I came to Michigan,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there was a scary number of high school kids believing that drugs were "cool".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And back in my country, back in middle school, I was the one who was misled,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I believed that bulled were a fact of life, I just didn't know to get help, I don't even tell my parents about them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I told my grand ma once,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">she immediately turned away, which was very unlike her...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And in passing said:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You're going to be OK, because you have a lion's heart."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is probably her fault that I wear a tail for Halloween,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and write poetry under Furkies Purrkies on cat pea dot com, thanks Grand Ma.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do you see what I am saying,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">indoctrination is a thing, because it is invisible to those who are indoctrinated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And can you see how easily a thousand books can help people to see themselves outside in,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and how probably all of them would dig them selves out before something bad happened.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A thousand narrated books, and in some cases, lectures and study guides that help with understanding them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">would sure help the world grow, #THOUSANDBOOKSCHALLENGE</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think <span>Ren&#xE9; Descartes<sup>[1]</sup></span> was the first famous philosopher to introduce the idea of warped reality,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and he would push back on traditions and encourage people to think things through, similar to therapy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But today with modern technologies,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">our thinking can be greatly helped by narrated books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever it is that we got stuck it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it only takes a hundred books to get unstuck, and another nine-hundred, just to be safe.</div>
