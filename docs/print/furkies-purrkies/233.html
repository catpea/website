    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My Friends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No century is ordinary, and such is the case with this one,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have a little bit of work to do, you may need to slow down with school and work a bit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will be creating a series of books about Real Education, Governing the World,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Human Rights, and a beautiful Survey Course half-jokingly entitled, The Human Manual.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today computers are everywhere, and they hold a powerful potential,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one that can enhance Education, The Voter and Democracy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one that can simplify bureaucracies and Governments.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity has been greatly enhanced by the experiment of mandatory education and free access to knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but the systems of standardized education have fallen behind on times,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must now use computers to cater to individual students,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and to remove the need of grades, replacing it with a simple history of self chosen subjects.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This a great endeavor,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for which few are ready.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As it always happens in Human History,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this challenge has been pressed upon our shoulders all too soon,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it has been accelerated by Climate Change, Anthropocene Extinction, Mass Incarceration,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Needles Borders that uselessly Divide our Human Family.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This century a Divided Humanity is a Weak Humanity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to face all the challenges and to ready the Younger Generations to carry on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must unite, the Internet has been Ready for years now.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What follows is an imperfect outline,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of much needed works that aim to Strengthen Humanity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and help all the children with all the challenges they are soon to face.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<p>Book One: Real Education,</p>
<p>this is a choose your own adventure type experience, that is to be published as a Paper Book,</p>
<p>as an Audio Book, as a Video Book, and finally taught in schools as a series of lectures.</p>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is very important, My Friends, in 2020, at the time of writing this document,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">schools were unable to teach students, they would only force them into memorization,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the motive was to receive state funding so that all school employees would get paid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">(Much will be said on this subject, but much of it won't matter,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because efficacy of education is _not_ judged by its collective test scores and trends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but rather; results. Its positive impact on the Voter, and City, State, and Nation Governments,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and above all the well being of our Planet.)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Book Two: Governing The World,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a book about establishing a Computer Program Managed Democracy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is very much an augmented reality, a mirror of our world where our voices count for more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The program harnesses the Wisdom of the Educated Humanity;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for City, State, Nation, and Earth management.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is worth noting that it is to have its beginnings as a Interactive Fiction game,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is collaboratively expanded, much like the world encyclopedia.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Book Three: Human Rights,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a volume detailing stories about growing up in the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is just essays that highlight what people can do to help the World Grow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and how to go about it to become triumphant.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This book speaks about a path to a United Humanity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is not just about putting an end to the idea of borders as the European Union so nobly demonstrates,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it is about getting ready to commit all ideas that result in dividing us to history books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and accepting the fact that we are just one family, that we are the Wise Caretakers of Earth and all of Her Inhabitants.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Human Rights must also highlight the problem of inequality that leads to Incarceration,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">people are going to prisons due to lack of Education and Knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Due to Stress, Poverty. Mental Disorders and Illness some of which is rooted in Neurological Disorders born from poverty, addiction, and unsafe environments.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Prisons must be replaced with Schools,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Human beings do not belong in cages.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Furthermore,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first and foremost purpose of a Government is to end poverty, homelessness, hunger, and sickness to the best of our abilities.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This means a Universal Basic Income, real money indistinguishable from a paycheck earned by hard work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People who face Poverty, Hunger, Homelessness, treatable Illness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who feel isolated or excluded, will be unable to study and comprehend these great Works of Love that this text describes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are One Family, we need their help, we need all of Humanity to permanently come together and leave bad ideas behind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Book Four: The Human Manual,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Is a Book of world's most inspirational and beloved essays.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">cheerful chapters for Mighty Five Year Olds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">inspiring essays for the Unstoppable Ten Year Olds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a loving introduction to the complexity of the world for Fifteen Year olds,</div>

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These works are not meant to be set in stone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the doors to new essays, submissions, and repairs, will always be open.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They are to be translated into all the languages spoken today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in order to encourage global communication and unity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These works, are works of the Universal Human Love,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of Human Beings finally coming together to form a Single United Family.</div>
</div>
