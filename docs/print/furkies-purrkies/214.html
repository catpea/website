    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It felt so healthy to sit down to the first version,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the promise of creating a program that will change the world felt amazing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They settled on trusty bare bones <span>express<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the first routes they put in were view and edit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Carl Sagan once said, that if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you must first invent the universe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <span>Ward Cunningham<sup>[2]</sup></span> the inventor of WikiWiki,
  <div class="paragraph">has absolutely solved the problem of starting in the beginning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With just a few lines of code he opened the gateway to content creation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in the most simplest way possible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They already knew how to solve the problem of two users editing the same file at the same time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the inspiration for that came from CouchDB.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In short, a unit of disk information in the first Cosmopolis was not a file,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was a directory, with randomly named files prefixed with a version number.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, detroit/15-aabbd.txt, detroit/15-xyxx.txt</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The brilliant thing about this is that when two people save version 15 at the same time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the random name of the file decides which version 15 is used, via a simple alphanumeric sort.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If there are 32 people editing the same file, and they all click save at the same time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and if some of the version 15 files arrive a second late because they have to travel across a slow network,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by relying on blindly picking the topmost entry after an alphanumeric sort, once they get all the data,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">every participating server in the world will agree on the same version 15.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It should be noted that at this point the file will be flagged as having many conflicts,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and users will be called to take a look at the different version and manually pick and choose the good parts,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this time everyone will be careful to just wait until the latest version is compiled.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, they had a collaborative editing platform in less than 100 lines of code,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">basically a blank Wikipedia.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So now came the big question,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which part of the universe do we create first to get that apple pie going?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They briefly considered to name the city Uruk,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">after the oldest city in the world, but settled on Night City instead.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And so it was, just like Wikipedia once had its first article,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">cosmopolis now held the first city: http://localhost:3000/view/night_city</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This was both exiting and terrifying, this program was meant to bring peace to the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they only had a blank page for an imaginary city.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Adding user support had to come in next,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just like every city had a page, so did every user.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Thus, Night City would receive its first two citizens,</div>
  <span>Alice and Bob<sup>[3]</sup></span>.
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Out in the server room the admin was already preparing for corruption simulations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and she named the malicious politician Mallory.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Alice and Bob represented computer programs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they were chatbots.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">However, the bots are separate programs that use Cosmopolis like a user would,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they would log in, check messages, scan for phrases they recognize and then perform some task within Cosmopolis.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The bots weren't really inspired by anything other than old <span>MUD<sup>[4]</sup></span> programs but there was a beautiful line of code,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that one of the leads always looked at, <span>line 26<sup>[5]</sup></span> in a sample script of github's hubot.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The bots were special,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they greatly simplified simulations and reasoning about this virtual test city.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As a whole they already created a very simple,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but living simulation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example one internal bot would be responsible for generating weather in Night City,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the bot actually got its information from Detroit's own weather service.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And our virtual Alice had a setting in her profile,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that would alert her when it was raining, she would then equip an umbrella before leaving for work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Bots gave Cosmopolis that early life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that made working on the system fun.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But by far the most special thing about bots,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">was that they could be replaced by a real human,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by a person that would turn off the bot and log in into their account.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the next release of the program,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the girls focused on enhancing this feature.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A bot could be instructed to ship groceries from Amazon,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but when a real person took over for an account,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they could go to a local store and buy and deliver the groceries for a small payment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even in the early tests, it was becoming more an more obvious,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that a powerful automated framework that could help people make money could be built.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As with every program the girls were worried about its adoption,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it was universally agreed that people would join to make money,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and in the end large cities would go online within weeks,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because it helped people put food on the table by trading small services.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Cosmopolis 2.0 was what got the attention of United Nations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but that is a story for another time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Personal Note,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Becoming a programmer is not that hard, and when you have a dream like our story of Cosmopolis here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it becomes a fun hobby that you just aimlessly poke at when there is some time in a day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a tradition of creating Programming Cook-books, they are books tailored for a specific language,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that contain short recipes, and it is really fun to flip through it, and see what this programming thing is about.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I recommend learning JavaScript, which is currently called ES2020, to actually execute a program you will need an interpreter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your browser has one built in, as JavaScript is the language of the web, look up how to open the web console in your browser of choice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">
    The industry standard for server-side JavaScript applications like our Imaginary Cosmopolis is <span>Node.js<sup>[6]</sup></span>,
    if interested you can <span>search for video tutorials<sup>[7]</sup></span> to help you get started.
