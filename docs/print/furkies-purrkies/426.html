    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was a couple of old trees,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">far up on a hill.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I was little I use to wonder about them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">once I grew up a little I used to wander towards them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was a perfectly calm place,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">be it winter or summer.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There were no troubles there,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so I had a lot of fun.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I used to make proper little bonfires,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">out of the branches that fell from the wind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I tried to figure out how the world works,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">from up there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I figured,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it wasn't working very well.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I grew up in a country with protests,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">shortages, and probably a lot of corruption.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I was eight, the Chernobyl disaster struck,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">people were told to stay home behind concrete walls.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I remember people reminding each other not to pick up mushrooms,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as they had something to do with radiation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was a strange man on TV Anatoly Kashpirovsky,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and people were pretending that he was healing them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some said that after they warmed up the gunk in their Russian watches by holding them in their hand,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it would be him that would restart them, other said he was sharpening their razors or something.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All too weird for me, so I'd slowly climb my way up that enormous hill to my Rain Makers</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and stare at the world from up there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I came up with the name Rain Makers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they looked like they were scratching clouds.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One time I brought a slice of refrigerated home made up there pizza up there,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">my mom made it the day before, it had olives.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was too cold to eat it right,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was a shame to eat it cold like that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So I started a proper little fire,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I always had matches with me.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And I somewhat-believe it was me who invented a sure way to start a fire,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you had to start with twigs that were just about the size of the match.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then sprinkle in larger, and larger, and larger bits,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">until the fire was cheerfully crackling.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I sharpened a stick that stabilized the slice,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and started heating it up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just the moment I did that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">rain came, the ground was already somewhat muddy - it was a rainy day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I looked around and figured I should build a shelter,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to keep myself dry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I easily moved a load of mud above a thick root,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and scooped a place for myself to perch in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Few more sticks, and some downed branches with leaves on them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I had a waterproof stealth shelter worthy of a big fat rabbit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I hunkered down into the hole,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and ate my slice of pizza that went from tasting odd due to being cold...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To now tasting and smelling weird,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as I was using leaves to keep the fire going.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I had no idea it would make my slice smell and somewhat even taste odd,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but I enjoyed it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The rain stopped,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and so so I slowly started making my way back down to the village.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Always somewhat worried if any geese want to hiss at me again,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and if perhaps I could find something interesting in the endless boxes at the garage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The geese were a huge problem for me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to make things worse they would always hang out right in the spot that I needed to cross to get back.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every adventure, as you can imagine, and even if you can't,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">always, always without a fail, has some fantastic cherry on top.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once I begun running away from hunters,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that were walking my way, and before I knew it...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I guess I tricked myself into thinking they were following me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but get this, there needed up being a small fire, right where they disappeared into the woods.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was watching them from the safety of my village home,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">through my high powered monoculars.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My grandpa asked if I knew anything about the fire,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">yup, I snapped back, and reported that the hunters did it, no question about it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They probably threw a cigarette on the ground,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the leaves caught fire.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Another time, I kid you not,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I ended up resting a bit, beneath an ice sheet!</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The small river was high when the top froze,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but when I got there the river was down to a trickle</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it had a proper and sturdy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">roof of ice over it, it was magical!</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was warned to stop expeditioning up to my trees.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because the wheat filed workers that ran combines up there,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">found some creepy Chupacabra Gollum type creature.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I quickly put my detective hat on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">sharpened some mean sticks for protection, and mounted an urgent expedition to find more evidence of the creature.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On my way up there I encountered one of the villagers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and he had some more info on what has now become a village legend, creepy talk of the town really.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Apparently they discovered the place where the was hiding,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and watching the village from.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They assumed it was some genetic anomaly,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because it lived in the cold ground by one of the trees up there, and it wasn't man sized...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh!",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I exclaimed suspiciously.</div>
