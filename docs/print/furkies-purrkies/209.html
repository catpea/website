    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The simplest, most resilient, tested and lasting unit of information,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that can transfer large amounts of knowledge between Human Beings, is a book.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Reading a raw book is like eating soup from a can,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is very nutritious, it tastes OK, it is fine, but there is a better way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To improve a book we can use a capable narrator to read it, and record it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">creating an audio book that we can bring with us on an adventure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, we can pack a day pack and go to a nearby State Park with long winding trails,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">along the way we can relax, enjoy the season, the atmosphere, and learn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Combining a Nature Walk with the Audio Book version,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">reveals the original paper book for what it really is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A paper book is about long term storage of ideas that can be archived for ages,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and enjoyed for hundreds if not thousands of years.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A book should be decoded from text to audio,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">only then can we fully process the ideas that the author wants to share.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To back up this claim, think of a Business asking employees to read a particular book,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">would it not be much better to help the employees to a day off an gift them a well narrated audio version?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A good book is more than just a thing to be read line by line,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a book not only contains ideas and tools for thinking but also the author at the time of writing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To read a book for real, we really have to hear the author speak,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to be able to feel their Soul, Heart, and Spirit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Should the author prove worthy we should become friends with them across space and time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">perhaps even make them part of our extended family and put their photo near or on the Fireplace Mantel.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A good book, is a book that makes us a better person by transferring some hard earned wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a kind of timeless love, that helps the world to become a wiser and better place.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Much of the World is still divided by imaginary borders,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the division relies on political, religious and cultural indoctrination presenting a subset of reality, if not warping it entirely.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Making wisdom more accessible, especially to young people who learn the fastest and are about to face challenges previously unseen,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is more than just a good idea, it is our moral duty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I ask all the companies who hold the ability to release meaningful audio-books to students, to do so, right now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we should not hope to make money by restricting or impeding access to knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not to the generation that now faces the problems we were unable to stop ourselves from propagating.</div>
