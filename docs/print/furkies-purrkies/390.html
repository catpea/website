      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">What Would Real High School Be Like? Students Would Be Paid For Progress.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The primary purpose of High School would be the creation</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of the beginning of the road to financial independence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The more successful their business undertakings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the more money they would make.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers, and experienced students, would help groups of founders,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with formation of small sturdy companies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To be clear, the idea of dividing Middle School from High School,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">based on age, is a stupid idea.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A person starts High School when Middle School ceases to be challenging,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Middle School is just a simpler and slower version of High School.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These schools are for young people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what divides High School from College is the number of talks and presentations about how the world functions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Talks are events where renowned speakers and professionals share their thoughts,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">be it via video lectures or in person.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These presentations will help the students discover their curiosities,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and find a few paths that they may wish to explore in more detail.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers should be present here, especially during pre-recorded presentations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">these teachers are mostly made up of successful graduates, success is a requirement for the position.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">High School will require a network of Investors to whom the students may present their ideas,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">should the ideas require external investment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By the age of 20, when students are ready to move on to College,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they should have several small side-businesses and belong to at least one multi-founder company that shows great promise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is only fair that Students, the future of this world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">should not begin their lives in poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">College is just a more complex version of High School,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where High School makes Business Creation easy, College is an introduction to business and legal frameworks, going public and investing and so on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No everyone will wish to spend their days on Practical Applications,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">people who find more inspiration in the Theoretical or Virtual will be guided towards existing companies that require that type of talent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If something does go wrong,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">College is the place that will help Students repair, or rebuild, or change directions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Text books, are replaced with a Knowledge Map, an open global collaborative network of lectures, narrated books, and countless presentations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The World Curriculum.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is the scaffold that guides students to their calling, or new inventions, or curiosities,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a self paced system of open pathways previously taken by other students.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Communities of students will organically emerge and form networks throughout the World Curriculum,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and like minded individuals of varying levels of expertise will be able to openly discuss their curiosities.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a very fluid system driven by curiosities and financial independence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one that offers guidance and a great deal of inspiration by means of presentations, lectures, and talks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is not enough rigidity here to discourage a Composer, or prevent an Artist from reaching their dreams,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the new School System, is meant to accelerate the Development of Human Kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must never stand in the way of the younger generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must honor the younger generations with Real Education, and Real Future.</div>
