  <p>We often think of consequences to mistakes,</p>
  <p>but consequence does not pick.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So as long as we keep to our paths,</p>
  <p>all our actions cast changes ahead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In mistakes, lessons await,</p>
  <p>in good deeds, we find family.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In great adventure, we&apos;ll find mountains,</p>
  <p>in great achievements, calm and peace.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In darkness, we will find light,</p>
  <p>in isolation, we&apos;ll find hugs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So as long as we keep to our paths.</p>
  <p>what we shall find will make us stronger.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>However, if we dare so to diverge,</p>
  <p>all we have cast we&apos;ll be lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Perhaps no shadows, but certainly no light,</p>
  <p>no lessons, no sweetness, no might.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>By switching paths we&apos;ll find fewer wisdoms,</p>
  <p>and far more things that don&apos;t fit us.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We&apos;ll also find a force of opposition,</p>
  <p>it will keep our minds tired.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It will be unclear why life seems strange,</p>
  <p>why everything takes so much more to see.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Why we seem to lack confidence,</p>
  <p>or how everyone else has so much of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But, the most troubling thing, my Dear Friends,</p>
  <p>is in how easy it is to diverge.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There is a place for Leaps of Faith in life,</p>
  <p>they are quite sacred, and as beautiful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But, to fill in a stranger&apos;s blanks,</p>
  <p>or trust that the others know what they are doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To listen to good advice that considers you naught,</p>
  <p>or give something up of your self, and not know why.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To go to a place because everyone went there,</p>
  <p>to bow because all others bowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That is not sacred, sacrilegious maybe,</p>
  <p>you must never follow, you must always lead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Even more troubling is how it all collapses,</p>
  <p>not with a bang, but a stupid sick whimper:</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>&quot;How were they supposed to know&quot;,</p>
  <p>&quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All the blame for what others did,</p>
  <p>to Your Sacred Self, somehow falls back right on you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then it turns out,</p>
  <p>your lesson is all over cheap paperbacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Everyone has been trough this,</p>
  <p>and none were the wiser.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All those confident faces and smiles, were faked,</p>
  <p>and the more convincing they try to be, the less they are in pain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When someone is putting you at risk,</p>
  <p>take a split second to imagine them saying:</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>&quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;, and stand your ground.</p>
  <p>You are not to follow, you are to lead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let them have have their stupid games, and drinks, temporary junk,</p>
  <p>you go to the DIA, take some notes, and splurge on clay.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Find a gallery worthy of your works,</p>
  <p>resume where Rodin left off.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Instead of filling the blanks,</p>
  <p>show the world the shapes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>How can your other half recognize you,</p>
  <p>when you are traveling on some other path.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>What you many not do, is to start at the bottom,</p>
  <p>all those cheap novels, they describe starting at the zero.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Start where all the heroes left off,</p>
  <p>read a handful of novels, and move on to their Memoirs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Your life depends on knowing what it is and where to start,</p>
  <p>and what to avoid.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It will get lonely, yes.</p>
  <p>You&apos;ll be lonely because you don&apos;t drink, and don&apos;t do stupid things.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You&apos;ll be lonely, but, You&apos;ll be You,</p>
  <p>you will shine your own light, and. you. will. be. seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Get up, step up,</p>
  <p>create and speak with art, and you&apos;ll talk with the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Grab pencils, trace with an Office Projector,</p>
  <p>and bring your Tortillon along.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>At the gym, dance,</p>
  <p>your way is the only way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You may get lonely,</p>
  <p>but for long.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Try to help people learn, what you have learned,</p>
  <p>become an assistant, a tutor, and a substitute teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Keep track of your Peace Corps application,</p>
  <p>just keep adding to it, keep re-sending it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They probably don&apos;t read it until version 50, anyway.</p>
  <p>It gives you time to revise and refine the ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To begin walking your own path,</p>
  <p>is to enter, The Grand Path of Pursuits of Excellence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Everything on your own path will add to you,</p>
  <p>there will be no limit to how far you can travel.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Stay on your own path, avoid generic advice, read Memoirs,</p>
  <p>keep moving up, and always try to move faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Learn about new things,</p>
  <p>expand your knowledge, every day.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If it is something you don&apos;t understand,</p>
  <p>find an Audiobook about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Stay sharp, stay fit,</p>
  <p>endurance training goes well with Audiobooks, and Love of Wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Others must have no influence on you,</p>
  <p>this is not their life, it is your life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Move at your own pace, and in your own sequence,</p>
  <p>make your 90 old self laugh, at how amazing you are.</p>
