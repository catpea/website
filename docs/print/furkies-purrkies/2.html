  <div class="paragraph">Don't aim at success.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then you will live to see that in the long-run&#x2014;in the long-run, I say! &#x2014; success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it.</div>
