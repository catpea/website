  <div class="paragraph">If you want change, you can't continue doing the same things you've always done.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you really want change, then you are going to have to alter your course, now.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't fight back, you will always lose,</div>

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There cannot be a compromise between good and evil,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a compromise only takes from the good, and only give s to the evil.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your office window, is not a substitute for a Call to the Wild,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your next promotion does not actually make you a greater person.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A vacation, cannot set you free, it is not a substitute for nature.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Dressing beautifully, has never made a person truly beautiful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Waiting for that perfect someone, will not help them notice you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Trusting that someone else will help you, is just another delay.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And just getting out there, is not enough to be understood.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And going out, following friends, can only put you on somebody else's path.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Life is not hard, it only gets complicated when you follow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because by following you just end up in places you don't understand.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">In your own direction, towards the things that move you, only then can You be Trully Moved.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It must the correct combination of books, poems, steps, events, summers, and epochs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not try to hurry, do not change roads, only move up, only think, and envision, and grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That which leads to Your Greatness, to Your Freedom, to Your Nature, requires, Truth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Walk your own path at your own pace. Only the correct key, can set your mind free.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The others who seem to have it all right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Often get lost on alien paths, and merely put on a happy face.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While it seems like you are trapped today, you are not, it is just an illusion.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Look towards the car keys.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is all it will take. Grab the keys and go.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It will be very difficult at first.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The toxic build up that is keeping you from getting up, right now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">takes three days to crumble. It is a heavy cage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But there is a way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A simple way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Grab the keys, and go... i275 south, merge onto 75 south,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and take it all the way down... Florida Keys, US Highway One.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you live in Florida, then you are headed for Michigan's Upper Peninsula.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you live West, your destination is all the way East.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not the destination, it is the Journey, my Friend.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take your time, watch the cage crumble and fade as you go.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Only the important things, will stay.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And you'll get to see yourself again.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And you'll get to be free again,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will resume where you left of.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A life of bondage,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is not worthy of you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Life is not meant to be a cage, or cruel, or frighten you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You knew this as a child, and you let that slip away, not even noticing when it went.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is your Right to resist being pushed into places that you don't want to be in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is your Right to reject conditions that you never agreed to, that you were pushed into.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">How else can the Universe be worthy of us, how else can our lives be beautiful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Heaven and Paradise are real, but they are now, right now. Now.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">How can people love you, when your own love for yourself is slipping away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to. You have to accept the responsibility for your Health, and Dignity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You don't have to make it all the way, the first time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you don't have to leave your phone behind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can call this therapy, or a vision quest, you can call it a road trip.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are not allowed to live in a cage, of whatever constitution, that will make you ill.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It comes to you naturally to take care of your body,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but your mind also requires care.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you reach your Freedom, you'll know what to do next,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it can be another trip, East, or West.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you feel trapped, the Universe is darker for it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take a week. Or two. Forty days is best. call it your Quarantine.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Unless you clear you mind, and focus on what is important,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">on you and those worthy of your care, you will lose it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will forget the beautiful person you truly are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will fall from heaven, and forget about paradise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And life will turn into a black and white TV show.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You must take good care of your mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If there is no one else that cares about you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then look at this poem.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I care.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hi!</div>
