  <div class="paragraph">Your Ideas, Curiosities, Adventures, Doodles, and Little Poems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is all there is, and it is all that will hold the world together.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">From the little seed of your notebook, your trusty pencil,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that one thing you posted on the internet that still impresses you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">grows a Brilliant Thinker.</div>
</div>

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A Custodian of Knowledge, A Lover of Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and a Great Being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you choose to practice resignation, if you fall,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the link of chain that holds the past and the future of Humanity will weaken.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The many Hearts, of The Great Beings that rose before you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will wail and howl, and the universe will become permanently darker for it.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">School is just the best all of the uneducated humanity at the time could agree on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is our first best try, and it was a failure that in its misery will now serve us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as a source of wisdom for building the second generation of schools.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This time everybody can see, that proper education is the best hope humanity has,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this time we will know the price that an Miseducated Earth pays.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People that made you feel unintelligent, made a mistake out of desperation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because they couldn't have know how to teach, because the idea of the classroom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and standardized education and testing is just an uninformed political fantasy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">crafted for simple and convincing displays of progress, and easy reelection campaigns.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">School was invented as an experiment by Great Self Taught Beings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">though it is broken, it still serves to keep the Global Level of Knowledge high enough,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for us to communicate about leaving bad ideas behind, and which are worth keeping.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We know it will be based on the way the Self Taught learn,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we know there will be no grades, just your brilliant path through the tree of knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The new generation of schools will bring Humanity closer together,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it will help us take better care of our Planet and its Inhabitants.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We used to think that school was an island,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it turned out to be the very thing that steers humanity forward in time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You were seen as students once,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and now you will be seen as Earth's Captains,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lighthouse Keepers, Navigators, and Admirals.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">If I may,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us begin by taking to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and setting it as the Opening Chapter of the New Text Book,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in recognition that school is directly responsible,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for the future of Earth and all her Inhabitants.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">May the first lesson, of this first New Text Book,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">stand to describe how vulnerable we are to cultural indoctrination,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the resulting following without thinking.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">May it serve as a cautionary tale,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and as an inspiration to Leadership, clear thinking,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and always choosing the harder right over the easier wrong.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">May all the countless chapters of this new book help each student,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">young or old to find their beginning and discover their unique path through Human Knowledge.</div>
