    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Woodland Adventures are pretty goofy, one moment you are tired and deprived,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the next, marching back to the camp with an ice cream sandwich in hand.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am ashamed to admit that I am the only person that has ever gotten lost at Nordhouse,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was my first time at the Nurnberg Trailhead so I was double excited.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I marveled at the sophistication of the site,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">including the shoe scrapers that remove seeds and mud, as not to cross-contaminate sites.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a 90 degree turn early on, and I tend to walk forward,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that's where I got lost the trail the first time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I found my self facing a large grassy field and murmured cheerfully,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there are *blep* snakes in these *bleep* plains.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A little further on, there was so much greenery and life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and out in the distance I spotted what seemed like a dune.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So I got off the trail and headed right for it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a very short trail, and the dunes are very big.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In no more than three minutes, I discovered that the dune I saw...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">was just a well lit tree, and that there were trees everywhere, and no trail in sight.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was no point in turning around, because I was already turned around,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so I did what every adventurer always does, I started walking in circles.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To my horror I discovered that enormous spiderwebs would often block my roundabout way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I'd have to make circles around those too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I remember becoming transfixed by a particularly large and seemingly thick Arachnid Installation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then my heart sinking as I felt an evil presence behind me.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I jumped around, to discover another confused man,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">only to realize that I was back on the trail and his expression of confusion was just how his face normally looked.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I immediately admitted that I got lost - peeling back some of the spider webs that ended up walking into,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">his expression of confusion turned to a smile...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Earlier he was probably wondering what the hell I was doing bushwhacking in complex circles,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whilst collecting all the spiderwebs in quiet panic, 20 feet from the trail.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Well, now he had his answer - I was an adventurer, in training,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was still learning the ropes, because it is not easy being green, in the green.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The hell with him,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and all his stupid spiders.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just the moment I promised myself to stay on the trail until I got to the beach,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there was a fork in the road, I wisely chose the path pointing towards lake Michigan.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was basically lost again, crossing through terrain that was clearly barely walked,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I made it back to the main trail, the one pointing away from the lake.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Covered in a toxic cloud of insect repellent,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and some seriously pissed off mosquitoes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I itched my way to the edge of the tree line,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and took a leap of faith into the bright sun and sandy dunes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was like discovering an Ocean,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">everything seemed so huge, the dunes were enormous.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was a beautiful adventure, on a sunny and beautiful day,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I swam in the lake, watched the sunset, and I had sausages for dinner.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I probably stayed out there a whole month, collecting fossils, making walking sticks, eating ice cream,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then I went back few months later, in early Fall for even more silly adventures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I remember advising a group a hikers to take the right the more traveled path at the fork,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">many new comers take the one on the left towards the lake, but that one is more difficult.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">...and whatever you do,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">stay on the trail, and don't take any shortcuts.</div>
