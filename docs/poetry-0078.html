        <p>Why does Philosophy seem so foggy,<br>
          so unclear, and uncertain.</p>
        <p>Living above yourself, transcending your limits,<br>
          puts you in a wiser state, more complex state, harder to understand state.</p>
        <p>I can&apos;t describe that directly,<br>
          but I can describe it by subtle analogy to other things.</p>
        <p>You know how your Dad questionably, pokes around a car engine,<br>
          and yet all of that seems a bit foggy?</p>
        <p>Do you remember what it was like to jog the first time,<br>
          and then you just kept going?</p>
        <p>Can you imagine your first 18 miles at the Appalachian Trail,<br>
          and can you see your last 18 miles as you near Katahdin.</p>
        <p>You know how mathematics sound impenetrable?<br>
          Until you become a mathematician?</p>
        <p>There are gaps, discomforts, vocabularies, perceptual frameworks,<br>
          that stand between you and the wisest you.</p>
        <p>You have to cross those things,<br>
          to unfog your mind.</p><br>
        <p>Learn to jog, to sprint, to body build,<br>
          and find a pathway to your best self by subtle analogy to training.</p><br>
        <p>Learn to backpack,<br>
          to walk out in front of a lone wolf, let your eyes connect in loneliness and familiarity.</p>
        <p>Snarl down a Mountain Lion,<br>
          with a God Like Growl, out of you entire life force, and culminating in a Wild Howl.</p>
        <p>Let your Lycanthropy belch a low rumble as you stand your ground,<br>
          to the test of a charging Black Bear.</p>
        <p>And learn from the Calm and Power of a Grizzly Bear,<br>
          Ursus Horribilis.</p><br>
        <p>Or, become an artist. You don&apos;t need a charging bear to learn.<br>
          You can use clay, or canvas, or music.</p>
        <p>There is no finer way to push loneliness away,<br>
          than to sculpt the meaning of touch.</p>
        <p>And there is no better way to learn courage,<br>
          than to paint a chain of works that inspire to motion.</p>
        <p>And music need not make someone cry to be powerful,<br>
          make the beat move your own feet, as you run your first ultra.</p><br>
        <p>Consider how simple a Desktop in your Operating System is,<br>
          and yet, how perfectly impossible it is, to drag the icon out of the computer.</p>
        <p>It is right there, you can wiggle it,<br>
          and yet it is trapped in a prison, of invisible walls.</p><br>
        <p>And consider, how different you are, from all the people you have met,<br>
          how you don&apos;t even smile at the things that make them laugh.</p>
        <p>How not a single person out of the Eight Billion,<br>
          could possibly take your place.</p>
        <p>How often it feels that all the people around you are sleepy,<br>
          how some seem different, because they could not do, what they do, if they were not wide awake.</p>
        <p>To integrate with wisdom, you cannot read the same books others read,<br>
          your mind represents a perfectly unique constellation of stars.</p>
        <p>To integrate with wisdom,<br>
          not only do you have to indirectly wiggle around by subtle analogy to other things.</p>
        <p>But you have to fish out just the perfect morsels that fit you,<br>
          in just the perfect sequence, out of a unique collection of mutually reinforcing works of Philosophy.</p><br>
        <p>You start in the beginning, with Survey Courses, as these outline the most brilliant ideas first,<br>
          there you can recognize thoughts that fit you, that you already had in your constellation.</p>
        <p>Organized Education, poisons your confidence in education, because everything they teach,<br>
          is in an inhuman, synthetic, and impersonal sequence.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the easily forgotten and fragile clusters of incomplete information,<br>
          aim to build on one another, they guarantee you won&apos;t understand, and will only overwhelm you in the end.</p>
        <p>The celebrating of a Diploma, is a sacred ritual, that has been erased, and replaced,<br>
          with a more sugarcoated &quot;I am finally out&quot;.</p>
        <p>This is a perfect recipe for bondage, blindness, weakness,<br>
          and worse.</p>
        <p>We must not allow a fake sugar pop triumph,<br>
          to replace the Real Triumph or Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
        <p>It can only get worse,<br>
          a day will come when the Libraries will close.</p>
        <p>School and Library, above all, were meant to be a symbol,<br>
          an extension to your own self education.</p>
        <p>Your Education,<br>
          the pathway to Peace, Safety, Security, Self Control, Harmony, Enlightenment.</p><br>
        <p>What has occurred to cause the fog, is a drop of packets of information,<br>
          we are too complex, the world is too complex, parenting is too complex, teaching is too complex.</p>
        <p>It can get worse, if we continue celebrating false graduations, and fake education,<br>
          if we keep forgetting that our family, has Eight Billion members and each must grow up for real.</p>
        <p>The solution is to remind ourselves, that growing up is not about feeling like an adult,<br>
          but rather Transcending our Limits, and Pushing Through gaps, towards Wisdom.</p>
        <p>We face problems that can only be solved by Intellectual or Cultural Unity.</p>
        <p>The Problem of War, is solved by Education, Wisdom, and Unity.</p>
        <p>The Problem of Education, is solved by Helping Everyone to a Fair Start.</p>
        <p>The Problem of Crime, can be Solved by Mental Heath Care, and Prevention.</p>
        <p>The Problem of Poverty and Slavery, is Solved by Universal Income.</p>
        <p>All these problems are our problems, and the solutions are ours as well.</p>
        <p>But they rest across a Gap, a gap that Humanity must cross.</p>
        <p>And the next step,<br>
          is your step.</p><br>
        <p>Nothing worth your precious time, can be faked, or made up, or make believe,<br>
          it all has to be Authentic, Powerful, Guttural, Raw.</p>
        <p>It will hurt in the Muscle and Bone,<br>
          but eventually you&apos;ll forget to pay attention to what is unimportant.</p>
        <p>You are not to be taught that you are dime a dozen,<br>
          and that they just can&apos;t find a job for you, because you don&apos;t fit or conform.</p>
        <p>People believe this nonsense,<br>
          because they don&apos;t have anything to draw from by subtle analogy.</p>
        <p>That is why we must challenge ourselves to Great Deeds,<br>
          to acquire the experiences necessary to tell Wisdom from Waste.</p>
        <p>When you hear someone putting you down, pushing you around, belittling you,<br>
          you are to leave, because that someone has fractured and broke, and are now ill.</p>
        <p>It is the oldest and sickest trick,<br>
          to convince someone they don&apos;t matter.</p>
        <p>They do it for personal gain, money or laziness,<br>
          to people who do not have a library of Grand Experiences from which they can draw wisdom, by Subtle Analogy.</p><br>
        <p>Get Up.</p>
        <p>Find your temple of solitude, The Two Beautiful Trees, The Bridge Over Hudson River,<br>
          The Highway Overpass, The Starry Beach where the Stars Come Out at Night and mingle with Starfish.</p>
        <p>And know, that you are a Child of The Universe, first,<br>
          That! is your background.</p>
        <p>Now face Humanity anew,<br>
          out from the edge of the Universe.</p>
        <p>Look,<br>
          look at all those things that made you small.</p>
        <p>Look how unimportant the inauthentic is,<br>
          how fragile those words that upset you really were.</p><br>
        <p>And pay attention, to the real problem,<br>
          how easily you were tricked and mislead.</p>
        <p>That cannot go on,<br>
          you are not a push around.</p>
        <p>I wish you knew how Powerful you really are,<br>
          how easily you learn at your own pace in the sequence that fits you best.</p>
        <p>How All Too Human, all too familiar, all too easy,<br>
          the acquisition of wisdom really is.</p><br>
        <p>Not all Adults are defined by Outspoken Wisdom, some find Greatness in Love Returned,<br>
          and what a Great Power, can those Two even make a mistake?</p>
        <p>I don&apos;t think there is anything other than Love, that can substitute for Wisdom,<br>
          it is both The Love of Two, and The Love of a Big Mother in a large family,<br>
          a Mother that always brings hugs, warm meals and Wisdom.</p>
        <p>But, True Love is rare, so while you search, you must also grow in Wisdom,<br>
          from now on, you will have to learn to tell the children apart from the adults.</p>
        <p>And not by looking at how old they are, or how well they dress, or how sharply they move in their environment,<br>
          you will now look at their Authenticity, and Content of Character.</p>
        <p>No one who lacks in Authenticity, or has little Content of Character,<br>
          has anything to contribute to you life, certainly nothing negative.</p>
        <p>Hope for them to recover, and become wise, and healthy,<br>
          let them know that they are a Child of The Universe, and they count - but go.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t let anybody hurt you,<br>
          don&apos;t let anybody hurt your heart, or mind.</p><br>
        <p>Go!<br>
          because you need your heart and mind, to grow.</p>
        <p>Go!,<br>
          with the certainty of knowing that you are more.</p>
        <p>Go!,<br>
          so as long as you Rise you won&apos;t be lonely for long.</p>
        <p>Go!<br>
          because there has never been a way other than forward and up.</p>
        <p>Go!<br>
          and don&apos;t be scared, all great journeys start with little things.</p><br>
        <p>The Others, who went through the same,<br>
          are with you in Spirit.</p>
        <p>So many invisible battles have been fought,<br>
          and as much triumph gone unnoticed.</p>
        <p>The Warriors are everywhere, and they stand by your side,<br>
          you are in company of Great Heroes.</p>
        <p>Climb by subtle analogy to the triumphs already had,<br>
          rise to the highest of mountains.</p>
        <p>You are Meant to Become a Great Being,<br>
          and You are meant to remind others to follow a similar path.</p>
        <p>Rise, and you will be well on your way,<br>
          Humanity only grows, when people like you tear down those thin invisible walls.</p><br>
        <p>Wherever you are right now, begin transcending your limits,<br>
          no matter how small, each will help you learn more.</p>
        <p>With each new success more pathways will become visible to you,<br>
          you are not trapped, you are just at the beginning of your journey.</p>
        <p>It is hard to see it all because you are still learning,<br>
          but it is easy to read or listen to books, and inherit great visions from others.</p>
        <p>It will never get easier,<br>
          but you will grow greater, to a point where ease will become irrelevant to your existence.</p>
        <p>You must use your Heart and Mind to learn all the lessons ahead,<br>
          no one can teach you, you must find your own books.</p>
        <p>By Subtle Analogy,<br>
          Rise to Your Greatness.</p>
